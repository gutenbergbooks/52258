</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> unexpected favour accorded to the first edition
of this work having already rendered a second
necessary, the author has taken the opportunity
of making many corrections and additions, and of
embodying the indices of both volumes in one.
The history, as it now stands, represents the services
of the Corps in detail as far as the year 1815, and
gives a summary of the services of those batteries now
in existence, which represent the troops and companies
of the old Royal Horse Artillery, and of the
nine senior battalions of the Royal Artillery. The
tables at the end of both volumes will also assist the
reader in tracing the antecedents of every battery
in the Regiment.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>The author takes this opportunity of expressing
his gratitude to his brother officers for the cordial
sympathy and encouragement which he has received
from them during his labours, and his hope that the
noble narrative commenced by him will not long
remain unfinished. The importance of completing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>the record of the Corps' services in the Crimea and
India, while the officers who served in these campaigns
are yet alive, is very apparent; and the
author would respectfully suggest that any documents
throwing light upon these services, which are
in the possession of any one belonging to, or interested
in the Corps, should be deposited for safe
keeping, and for reference, in the Regimental Record
Office at Woolwich.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the uneducated, discipline is created
by fear, and confirmed by habit. Among the
educated, the agency at work is more complicated.
Sympathy with the machine of which the individual
finds himself a part, and a reasoning apprehension
of the necessity of discipline, are mingled
with a strong feeling of responsibility; and, as in
the former case, habit steps in to cement the whole.
Of all these agents, the noblest is undoubtedly the
sense of responsibility, and the highest duty of a
military commander is to awaken this sense where
it does not exist, and to confirm and strengthen it
where it does.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>Two means may be employed to ensure this
end. First: let the importance of his duty be
impressed on the individual, and let the value in
a military sense of what might seem at first sight
trivial be carefully demonstrated. Let it be explained
that neglect of some seemingly slight duty
may disarrange the whole machine; and that for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>this reason no duty, in a soldier's eyes, should
appear slight or trivial. Second: let an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</span></i> be fostered, such as shall make a man feel it
a shame to be negligent or unworthy.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>History has a power to awaken this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>, which
it is impossible to overrate. Its power reaches
the educated and the uneducated alike; it begets
a sympathy with the past, which is a sure agent
in creating cohesion in the present; for the interest
which binds us to our predecessors binds us also
to one another. In this cohesion and sympathy
is to be found the most sublime form of true
discipline.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>In</span> the summer of 1682, for the space of nearly three
months, an old man might have been seen pacing daily
up and down near the Ordnance Offices in the Tower of
London, growing shabbier day by day, more hopeless and
purposeless in his gait, yet seeming bound to the place either
by expectation or command.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last with trembling hand he prepared for the Honourable
Board of Ordnance the following quaint petition:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The humble Petition of John Hawling, Master Gunner of</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His Majesty's Castle of Chester."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Sheweth</span>:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>"That y<sup>e</sup> Petitioner being commanded up by special order from
the office hath remained here y<sup>e</sup> space of 13 weeks to his great
cost and charges, he being a very poor and ancient man, not
having wherewithal to subsist in so chargeable a place.</p>

<p class='c014'>"He therefor most humbly implores y<sup>r</sup> Hon<sup>rs</sup> to take his sad
condition into your Honours' consideration, and to restore him
to his place again, y<sup>t</sup> he may return to his habitation with such
commands as your Hon<sup>rs</sup> shall think fitt to lay upon him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And your Petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To which Petition the Honourable Board returned the
following peremptory answer:—</p>

<p class='c014'>"Let y<sup>e</sup> Petitioner return back to Chester Castle, and there
submit himself to Sir Jeoffrey Shakerley, Governor, in y<sup>e</sup> presence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of Sir Peter Pindar and Mr. Anderton, and obey y<sup>e</sup> orders of y<sup>e</sup>
Governor and Lieut.-Governor of y<sup>e</sup> said castle, and upon his
said submission and obedience, let him continue and enjoy his
former employment of Master Gunner there, so long as he shall
so behave himselfe accordingly."</p>

<p class='c000'>John Hawling, this poor and ancient man, was one of the
small class of Master Gunners, and Gunners of Garrisons,
who with the few fee'd Gunners at the Tower, represented the
only permanent force of Artillery in those days in England.
Their scientific attainments as Artillerists were small, and
their sense of discipline was feeble. To take a very superficial
charge of Ordnance Stores, and to resent any military
interference, such as at Chester seems to have driven John
Hawling into mutiny, but at the same time to cringe to the
Board, which was the source of their annual income, represented
in their minds the sum and substance of their duties.
And taking into consideration John Hawling's offence, his
advanced years, and his petition, we do not err in taking him
as a representative man.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>In the House of Commons, on the 22nd of February, 1872,
the Secretary of State for War rose to move the Army Estimates
for the ensuing year. These included provision for a
Regiment of Artillery, numbering—including those serving
in India—34,943 officers, non-commissioned officers, and
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although divided into Horse, Field, and Garrison Artillery,
and including no less than twenty-nine Brigades, besides a
large <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Depôt</span>, this large force, representing the permanent
Artillery Force of Great Britain, was one vast regiment—the
Royal Regiment of Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>To trace the growth, from so small an acorn, of so noble a
tree, is a task which would inspire the boldest author with
diffidence: and when the duty is undertaken by one who
has had no experience in historical writing, he is bound to
justify himself to his readers for his temerity.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the writer of the following pages assumed, in
January, 1871, the duties of Superintendent of the Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Artillery Regimental Records, he found a method and order
established by his predecessor, Major R. Oldfield, R.A., all
the more remarkable when compared with the chaos too
often prevailing in Record offices. The idea immediately
occurred to him that if ever a History of the Regiment were
to be written—a book greatly wanted, and yet becoming
every day more difficult to write—here, in this office, could
it most easily be done. This feeling became so strong in
his mind, that it overcame the reluctance he felt to step
into an arena for which he had received no special training.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unwillingness felt by him was increased by the knowledge
that there was in the Regiment an officer, Colonel
F. Miller, V.C., who was eminently qualified for writing
such a History. Other and more pressing duties had, however,
prevented that officer from undertaking a work which
he had once contemplated; but of the many documents and
books which the author of the following pages has made
use of for his purpose, none has been more valuable than
an exhaustive pamphlet published some years ago by Colonel
Miller for private circulation, and his recent edition of
Kane's list of Artillery officers, with its comprehensive
Appendix.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said above that the writing of this History
has been every year becoming more difficult. The statement
requires explanation, as the difficulty is not caused so
much by the accumulation—continually going on—of modern
records, which might bury the old ones out of sight, as by
a change in the organization of the Regiment which took
place some years ago, and which sadly dislocated its history,
although possibly improving its efficiency. In the year 1859,
the old system which divided the Regiment into Companies
and Battalions, with permanent Battalion Headquarters at
Woolwich, was abolished; and Companies serving in different
parts of the Empire were linked together in Brigades, on
grounds of Geography, instead of History. Companies of
different Battalions serving on the same station were christened
Batteries of the same Brigade, and the old Battalion
staff at Woolwich became the staff, at various stations, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Brigades newly created. The old Companies, in donning
their new titles, lost their old history and began their life
anew. Every year as it passed made the wall which had
been built between the present and the past of the Regiment
more nearly approach the student's horizon, and the day
seemed imminent when it would be impossible to make the
existing Batteries know and realize that the glorious History
of the old Companies was their own legitimate property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evil of such a state can hardly be described. The
importance of maintaining the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i> of Batteries cannot be
overrated. And <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i> feeds and flourishes upon history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor can Battery <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i> be created by a <em>general</em> Regimental
history. The <em>particular</em> satisfies the appetite which refuses
to be nourished upon the <em>general</em>. The memory which will
gloat over the stories of Minden, Gibraltar, or Waterloo,
will look coldly on the Regimental Motto "Ubique." Therefore,
he who would make the influence of history most surely
felt by an Artilleryman must spare no labour in tracing the
links which connect the Batteries of the present with the
Companies of the past. For the Battery is the unit of Artillery:
all other organization is accidental. Whether the
administrative web, which encloses a number of Batteries,
be called a Battalion or a Brigade system, is a matter of
secondary importance. It is by Batteries that Artillerymen
make War; and it is by Batteries that their history should
be traced.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this feeling uppermost in his mind, the author of
these pages has endeavoured on every occasion to revive the
memories which will be dear to the officers and men of
Batteries—memories which ran a risk of being lost with the
introduction of a new nomenclature. On such memories an
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>, which no legislation can create, will blossom
easily and brilliantly; and no weapon for discipline in the
hand of a commander will be found more true than the power
of appealing to his men to remember the reputation which
their predecessors earned with their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>This first volume will give the present designation, the
past history, and the succession of Captains of the whole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the Companies of the seven Battalions formed during the
last century and of the old troops of the Royal Horse
Artillery. In the succeeding volumes, the same course will
be pursued with regard to the later Battalions.</p>

<p class='c000'>These stories will be all the more precious now, as the
importance of the Battery as a tactical unit has been so
distinctly recognized by His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cambridge within the last few months, and its responsibility
and value as a command have been so recently and generously
marked by the present Secretary of State for War.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>The author does not pretend to underrate the difficulties
of the task which he has undertaken—difficulties which
cannot be realized by those who see merely these inadequate
results of his labours. Not the least was the difficulty of
knowing where to begin. The Regimental organization is
comparatively recent; and had he confined his labours to
the last one hundred and sixty years, his task would have
been greatly lessened, and yet he might have said with literal
truth that he had written a History of the Royal Artillery.
But surely in any History worthy of the name there were
antecedent circumstances which could not be left unnoticed,
such as the circumstances which brought about the birth of
the Regiment, the blunders and failures which marked the old
system in England as wrong and foolish, and the necessity,
which gradually dawned, of having in the country a <em>permanent</em>,
instead of a <em>spasmodic</em> force of Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Repudiating, therefore, the notion that the Regiment's
History should commence with its first parade, how far was
he to penetrate in his antiquarian researches? There was a
danger of wearying his reader, which had to be avoided fully
as carefully as the risk of omitting necessary information,
for a history—to be useful in awakening <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>—should
be <em>read</em>, not shelved as a work of reference. It is in
this part of his labours that the author has to appeal for the
greatest indulgence, because writing, as he has generally
done, with all his documents and authorities round him for
reference, he may unconsciously have omitted some details
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>most necessary to the reader; or with some picture clearly
present to his own mind as he wrote, he may have given
light and shade which had caught his own fancy, and
omitted the outlines without which the picture will be
almost unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the many to whom he is indebted for assistance he
feels called upon to mention specially the Secretary of State
for War, by whose permission he had unlimited access to the
Ordnance Library in the Tower; Colonel Middleton, C.B.,
Deputy Adjutant-General of the Royal Artillery; General
McDowell, commanding the troops in New York; Lieutenant
A. B. Gardner, of the United States Artillery; and the
Committees of the Royal Artillery and United Service Institutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The works which the author has consulted are too numerous
to mention, but among those which were most useful
to him were Drinkwater's 'Siege of Gibraltar,' Murdoch's
'History of Nova Scotia,' Browne's 'England's Artillerymen,'
Clode's 'Military Forces of the Crown,' the Reports of the
House of Commons, the Records of the Royal Military
Academy, Kirke's 'Conquest of Canada,' Rameau's 'La
France aux Colonies,' Cust's 'Annals of the Wars.'</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>Among the mass of MSS. through which he had to wade,
the valuable manuscript notes connected with the 'History
of the Royal Artillery,' arranged by the late Colonel Cleaveland,
deserve special mention. The skeleton of this work,
however, was furnished by the old Record Books of the
Battalions, deposited in the office of which the author is
Superintendent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the succeeding volumes, the advantage of being able
to use the old letter-books of the head-quarter offices of the
Royal Artillery will be apparent. But there was no head-quarter
staff for the Regiment up to the time where this
volume finishes; so that the student has, up to that date,
to depend greatly on men like General James Pattison and
Forbes Macbean, who placed on record, in their diaries and
letter-books, valuable and interesting information connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>with the Regiment during their service, which would otherwise
have been hopelessly unattainable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The value of such a History as this, if the writer has not
utterly failed in his object, cannot be better shown than in
some words addressed by one of our most distinguished
Artillery officers (Sir E. C. Warde) to an audience at the
Royal Artillery Institution a few months ago. The family
affection which he urged as the model for Regimental <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>
cannot be better fostered than by reviving the stories of our
predecessors' gallant deeds and scientific excellence. As a
Regiment, we are now large almost to unwieldiness, and
conflicting interests and tastes tend to diminish the desired
sympathy and cohesion. And, as in the crowded pit of a
theatre before the performance commences, there is elbowing,
and crowding, and wrangling for place, yet when the curtain
rises all is hushed and quiet,—there is room for every one,—and
the look of selfishness is exchanged for one of interest
and pleasure,—so, among our great numbers, although there
must be many and diverse interests and tastes, yet we all
become as one as we gaze on the great dramas in which those
of us have acted who have gone before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The words used by Sir Edward Warde were as follows:—"It
has ever been our pride, as a corps, to be regarded as
one family; and if one member of it, in any remote part
of the world, in any way distinguished himself, it was felt
universally that he had reflected credit and honour on the
whole corps. And so, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>. Should we not, then,
extend those feelings as they apply to private families,
in which members embrace <em>different</em> professions? One
becomes a soldier, another a sailor, a third enters the
Church, a fourth goes up for the bar, and so on; and
if any one gain honour and distinction, all equally feel
that such honour and distinction is reflected upon the
whole family, and all equally glory and rejoice in it. So
should it be with us. Some of us take special interest in
the <em>personnel</em>, as it is well known to you all that I have
done throughout my career; but is that any reason why I
should not take an interest—aye, and a warm interest—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the success of those brother officers who pursue scientific
researches, and seek honour and distinction in the pursuit
of literature, and in endeavouring to raise the character of
our corps as one from which highly scientific attainments
are expected? No, indeed; the very reverse should be
our guiding rule; and I can conceive no position more
honourable than that held for so many years by our highly
distinguished brother officer, Sir Edward Sabine. Let us,
then, feel that we <em>are</em> one family, and let us rejoice in the
success of every one of its members, whether they are so
fortunate as to gain distinction in the field, in the siege,
or in literary and scientific pursuits; and by so doing may
we hope, not only to maintain our present high reputation,
but to increase it as time goes on."</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Masters-General of the Ordnance and their<br /> Honourable Board.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>There</span> are many reasons why the Masters-General of
the Ordnance must interest the student of the History
of the Royal Artillery. In the days before the Regimental
organization existed, all Artillery details came under the
care and superintendence of the Masters-General; and to
a distinguished one of their number does the Regiment owe
its formation. The interest becomes deeper and closer after
that date; for in addition to the general superintendence
which had already existed, the Master-General had now a
special interest in the Royal Artillery, in his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i>
capacity as its Colonel.</p>

<p class='c000'>And whatever objections may be urged against the Board
of Ordnance, the Royal Artillery, save in one particular,
has always had abundant and special reason for regarding
it with affection and gratitude. The almost fatherly care,
even to the minutest details, which the Board showed to
that corps over which their Master presided, was such as
to awaken the jealousy of the other arms of the service.
Had their government not been of that description which
attempts to govern too much, not a word could be said by
an Artilleryman, save in deprecation of the day when the
Board of Ordnance was abolished. Unfortunately, like a
parent who has failed to realize that his children have
become men, the Board invariably interfered with the
duties of the Artillery under whatever circumstances its
officers might be situated. No amount of individual experience,
no success, no distance from England, could save
unhappy Artillerymen from perpetual worry and incessant
legislation. The piteous protests and appeals which meet
the student at every turn give some idea of the torture to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>which the miserable writers had been exposed. The way,
also, in which the Board expressed its parental affection
was often such as to neutralize its aim. It was rare indeed
that any General Officer commanding an army on service
made an appointment of however temporary or trivial a
nature, which had to come under the approval of the Board,
without having it peremptorily cancelled. Even in time of
peace, the presence in every garrison of that band of conspirators,
known as the Respective Officers—who represented
the obstructive Board, and whose opinion carried far more
weight than that of the General commanding—was enough
to irritate that unhappy officer into detestation of the
Honourable Board and all connected with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been declared—and by many well able to judge,
including the Duke of Wellington himself—that in many
respects the Board of Ordnance was an excellent national
institution and a source of economy to the country. It
may be admitted that in its civil capacity this was the case,
and the recent tendency to revive in the army something
like the Civil Branch of the Ordnance proves that this
opinion is general. But, if we take a more liberal view
than that of mere Artillerymen, we must see that the
military division of its duties was only saved from exposure
and disgrace by the fact that the bodies of troops over
which it had control were generally small and scattered.
The command of the Royal Artillery, now that it has
attained its present numbers, could not have remained
vested in the hands of a Board constituted as the Board of
Ordnance was. What General Officer could have hoped to
weld the three arms of his division into any homogeneous
shape, while one of them could quote special privileges,
special orders, and sometimes positive prohibition, from a
body to which they owed a very special obedience? The
Royal Artillery may indeed have lost in little comforts
and perquisites by the abolition of the Board of Ordnance,
but in a military point of view, in proficiency, and in
popularity, the Regiment has decidedly been a gainer.</p>

<p class='c000'>While admitting, however, the advantages, nay, the necessity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of the change which has taken place, the long roll of
distinguished soldiers and statesmen who have successively
held the office of Master-General of the Ordnance is too
precious an heirloom in the eyes of an Artilleryman to let
pass without special notice and congratulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>From 1483, the earliest date when we can trace one by
name, down to the days of the Crimean war, when the
last Master-General died in harness, the brave, gentle Lord
Raglan, the list sparkles with the names of men who have
been first in Court and field, and who have deserved well
of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their duties were by no means honorary in earlier times,
although during the last fifty years of the Board's existence
the chief work fell upon the permanent staff, and the visits
of the Master-General were comparatively rare and ceremonious.
If any one would learn what they had to do in the
seventeenth century, let him go to the Tower, and examine
the correspondence of Lord Dartmouth, the faithful friend
and servant of Charles II., a professional Artilleryman and
James II.'s skilled Master-General to the last. He created
order out of chaos in the Department of the Ordnance, under
Charles II., and so admirable were his arrangements, that on
King William ascending the throne, he issued a warrant
ratifying all previous orders, and leaving the details of the
management of the Ordnance unaltered. In the autumn of
1688, Lord Dartmouth's office—never a sinecure—became
laborious in the extreme. Daily and hourly requisitions
reached him from the excited King and his Ministers, for the
arming of the ships and the Regiments which were being
raised in every direction. Authority was given to raise
more gunners, as if experience could be created in a moment
and the science of Artillery begotten in a man's mind, without
previous study, for "twelve-pence by the day." To
Chatham the Master-General hurries to superintend the
fitting-out of the men-of-war, and next day, for the same
purpose, to Sheerness, where he finds a despatch from the
trembling Privy Council, ordering him to fill six merchant
ships with fireworks to accompany the King's fleet, as fire-ships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>against the enemy. A terrible life did poor Lord
Dartmouth lead at this time. Sometimes his letters are
written from on board ship in the river, sometimes from his
cabin in the 'Resolution,' at Portsmouth; very frequently
from Windsor, where James anxiously kept him near his
person, plying him now with questions and now with contradictory
orders. Sometimes we find him writing at midnight,
ordering his loving friends, the principal officers of
the Ordnance, to meet him next day at the Cockpit, in
Whitehall; at other times he swoops down unexpectedly on
the bewildered officials in the Tower. In the old, quiet days,
his correspondence was distinguished by an almost excessive
courtesy; but now, in these days of fever and in the depth
of his anxiety, it almost disappears; orders are issued like
minute-guns; explanations of delay are fretfully demanded;
and a bombardment is incessant of peremptory inquiries as
to the state of His Majesty's ships and stores.</p>

<p class='c000'>His Lieutenant-General, Sir Henry Tichborne, has a hard
place of it at this time. With so energetic a Master at the
Board, his work hitherto has been of the lightest, and his
head seems now to reel under the change. For a few weeks
he holds out, but by the end of November in that eventful
year matters came to a crisis with poor Sir Henry. He can
no longer attend the meetings of the Board; a violent fit of
the gout prevents him, which he carefully warns his colleagues
will, in all likelihood, continue some time: and with
a piteous prayer that, out of the small sum in hand, the
Board will pay the salaries of the "poor gunners, as subsisting
but from day to day," Sir Henry's name disappears
from the Board's proceedings, and the History of the
Ordnance knows him no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this time the Honourable Board seems, when its
Master was absent, to have enacted the part of the Unjust
Steward, for we find various debts remitted to creditors who
could not pay, and not a small issue of debentures to those
whose friendship it was desirable to retain. All through the
records of their proceedings at this time is to be traced, like
a monotonous accompaniment in music, the work of that immovable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>being the permanent clerk. From the dull offices
in the Tower issue the same solemn Warrants, appointing
this man an Ordnance labourer at six-and-twenty pounds
a year, and that man a gunner at twelve-pence a day, just
as if no Revolution were at hand, and no foreign foe were
menacing the very existence of their King and Honourable
Board together. Lord Dartmouth may be guilty of curt and
feverish memoranda, but the permanent clerk never moves
out of his groove, nor shall posterity ever trace any uneasiness
in his formal work.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then comes the sudden gap in all the books; the blank
pages more eloquent than words; the disappearance of the
familiar signature of Dartmouth; and the student takes up
a fresh set of books where England took up a fresh King.</p>

<p class='c000'>The duties of the Master-General, and the various members
and servants of the Board of Ordnance, were first reduced to
a systematic form in Charles II.'s reign, while Lord Dartmouth
was in office. The Warrant defining these was
confirmed by James II. on the 4th February, 1686; by
William III., on the 8th March, 1689; by Queen Anne, on
the 30th June, 1702; by George I., on the 30th July, 1715;
and by George II., on the 17th June, 1727.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although some alterations were made by George III., they
were very slight, and rendered necessary by the occasional
absence of the Master-General and by the creation of the
Royal Military Academy at Woolwich—the Cadets attending
that institution being placed in a very special manner
under the care and superintendence of the Master and
Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance. The orders under
which the Board worked up to the beginning of this century
were, therefore, practically those instituted during Lord
Dartmouth's term of office; and in examining them, one
cannot fail to be struck with their exhaustive anticipation
of every circumstance which might arise for consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Master of the Ordnance, as he was originally called—sometimes
also termed the Captain-General of the Artillery—received,
in 1604, the title of Master-General; and was considered
one of the most important personages in the realm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Since the great Marlborough held the office, it has seldom
been given to any one not already possessed of the highest
military rank: but this was not always the case. Lord
Dartmouth was plain Colonel Legge when first appointed,
and the social, as well as military rank of his predecessors,
was sometimes far from exalted. It became, therefore,
necessary to attach to the office some relative military
status: and accordingly we find a Warrant issued by
James II., bearing date the 13th May, 1686, directing that
the Master-General of the Ordnance should always have
"the rank, as well as the respect, due to our youngest
Lieutenant-General: and that our will and pleasure is,
that he command in our Garrisons as formerly, but do not
take upon him the charge or command as a Lieutenant-General
in the field, without our especial commission or
appointment." The command in the Garrisons referred
to in the Warrant is in allusion to the Master-Gunners
and Gunners of the various Garrisons, whose allegiance to
the Board of Ordnance, as being, in fact, custodians of the
Ordnance Stores, was always insisted on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relative rank awarded to the Master-General entitled
him, when passing through any Camp or Garrison, to a
guard of 1 officer, 1 sergeant, and 20 men; the guards
were compelled to turn out to him and the drums to beat a
march; and the officers and soldiers of the Regiments he
passed had to turn out at the head of their respective
camps. In the old pre-regimental days, when the Master-General
took the field in time of war, in his official capacity,
he was attended by a Chancellor, thirty gentlemen of the
Ordnance, thirty harquebusiers on horseback, with eight
halberdiers for his guard, two or three interpreters, a
minister or preacher, a physician, a master-surgeon and
his attendant, a trumpeter, kettledrums, and chariot with
six white horses, two or three engineers, or more if required,
and two or three refiners of gunpowder. These kettledrums
do not seem to have been used in the field after 1748. They
were used by the train of Artillery employed in Ireland in
1689, and the cost of the drums and their carriage on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>occasion, was estimated at 158<em>l.</em> 9<em>s.</em> As the reader comes to
compare the wages of the drummer and his coachman—4<em>s.</em>
and 3<em>s.</em> per diem respectively—with the pay given to other
by no means unimportant members of an Artillery train, he
will realize what a prominent position these officials were
supposed to hold. The drummer's suit of clothes cost 50<em>l.</em>,
while a gunner's was valued at 5<em>l.</em> 6<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> Even the coachman
could not be clad under 15<em>l.</em>—nearly three times the
cost of a gunner's clothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prior to the date of King Charles's Warrant, the pay of
the Master-General had been very fluctuating, being considerably
affected by fees, and even by sales of places in
the department. By that Warrant, however, it was fixed at
a certain sum, inclusive of all perquisites, and the amount
would appear to have been 1500<em>l.</em> per annum. This remained
unchanged until the formation of the Cadet Company, when
the annual sum of 474<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> was added to the Master-General's
salary, in his capacity as Captain of the Company,
and charged in the Regimental accounts of the Royal Artillery.
Considerable strides in the direction of further augmentation
were afterwards made, more especially in 1801,
until we find Lord Chatham, in 1809, drawing no less than
3709<em>l.</em> per annum as Master-General of the Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an order forbidding any increase to the establishment
of the Ordnance without the King's sign-manual,
but it speedily became a dead letter; and changes were frequently
made without authority, involving additional expense,
and covered by something akin to supplementary estimates.
In fact, the Parliamentary Commission which sat in 1810 to
inquire into the various departments of the Ordnance ascertained
that both in matters of <em>personnel</em> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span></i> the
power of the Master-General in his own department was
simply unfettered. That it was not more frequently abused
speaks well for the honesty of the department, and the
honour of its chief officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance at the meetings
of the Board was like the Deputy-Chairman of a Company.
His powers were in abeyance when the Master was present:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>although there were one or two cases in which his signature
was required as one of the quorum necessary to legalize the
business transacted. His office was created by Henry VIII.,
the designation of General being added subsequently. Until
the days of Sir Christopher Musgrave he had an official residence
in the Minories; and on its being taken from him he
received in lieu the annual allowance of 300<em>l.</em> Another perquisite
of the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance was the
ground called, as the old deed expresses it, "Y<sup>e</sup> old Artillery
Garden situate near y<sup>e</sup> Spitle in y<sup>e</sup> parish of St. Buttolph,
Bishopsgate:" but this also being taken away from him,
he was allowed, in March, 1683, the large manor-house and
grounds commonly known as the Tower Place at Woolwich,
together with the Warren, &amp;c., where the Royal Arsenal now
stands, a name given on the occasion of the visit paid to it
by George III. in the spring of 1805. The use of this property
by the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance was, however,
trammelled by the following conditions:—"That the
proving of great guns should go on as heretofore in Woolwich:
that the Government should have full control over
all wharves, magazines, cranes, &amp;c., and that a dwelling
for the Master-Gunner of England should be allowed in
the said Mansion-house, and lodging for ten fee'd gunners
in the adjoining houses, and also for such Ordnance
labourers as might be necessary."</p>

<p class='c000'>The proper salary of the Lieutenant-General at first was
800<em>l.</em> per annum, supplemented, as mentioned above, by
300<em>l.</em> in lieu of a house; but rising like the pay of the other
officers of the Board, we find in 1810, that it amounted to
1525<em>l.</em>, besides an allowance for stationery. The Parliamentary
Committee which sat in 1810 and 1811 suggested
the abolition of the office of Lieutenant-General—a suggestion
which was ultimately carried out in 1831. It was
revived for a short time during the Crimean war, Sir Hew
Ross holding the appointment during the absence at the
seat of war of the Master-General, Lord Raglan; but this
was a contingency which the Committee had foreseen, and
was prepared to meet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>In examining the individual, apart from the collective,
duties of the principal officers of the Ordnance, we find that
the Lieutenant-General had the supervision of the military
branch, and acted as a sort of Adjutant to the Master, who
looked to him for all information connected with the various
trains of artillery at the Tower and elsewhere. These he
was bound always to have fit and ready to march: he had to
direct and superintend the practice of the Master-Gunner
of England, Firemaster and his mates, Fireworkers and
Gunners, and acquaint the Master with their proficiencies;
and also to see that all officials connected with the Department
did their several duties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other four principal officers of the Ordnance were the
Surveyor-General, the Clerk of the Ordnance, the Storekeeper,
and the Clerk of the Deliveries, any three of whom
formed a quorum. At the beginning of the present century
the salaries of these officials were respectively 1225<em>l.</em>, 825<em>l.</em>,
725<em>l.</em>, and 1000<em>l.</em> with a further annual sum of 200<em>l.</em> to the
Clerk of the Deliveries during war. The whole of the principal
officers were allowed 25<em>l.</em> a year for stationery, besides
certain patent fees varying from 54<em>l.</em> 15<em>s.</em> in the case of the
principal Storekeeper, to 18<em>l.</em> 5<em>s.</em> in that of the Clerk of
the Deliveries. The departmental expenses were swollen
by an army of public and private secretaries, clerks, and
attendants.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the work of the Lieutenant-General lay with the
<em>personnel</em>, so that of the Surveyor-General lay with the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span></i>. On him lay the responsibility of superintending
all stores, taking remains, and noting all issues and receipts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Clerk of the Ordnance had, in addition to the ordinary
correspondence of the department, to look after salaries,
debts, debentures, and bills falling due, and generally to
perform, on a large scale, the duties of a modern book-keeper.
If we may judge by the correspondence on financial matters
which is to be found among the Ordnance Records, there
must have been many a Clerk of the Ordnance whose days
and nights were haunted by visions of bills falling due which
could not be paid. During the times of the Stuarts, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>poverty of the office was sometimes as terrible as the shifts
to which the Board had recourse were pitiable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Money seems to have been more plentiful during the reign
of William III.; but when Queen Anne came to the throne,
England's continental wars drained the Ordnance exchequer
wofully; and while most of their debts were only paid in
part, many were never paid at all. An amusing incident of
the Board's impecuniosity occurred in 1713. An expedition
to Canada having taken place, the gunners and matrosses
employed were found after a time to be sadly in want of
clothing. The Commissary of the Ordnance on the spot,
being without funds, drew a bill on the Honourable Board
for 140<em>l.</em>, which instead of selling as usual to the merchants,
he disposed of to one of the gunners, apparently a man of
means, and destined ever after to be immortal, Mr. Frederick
Price.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bill, in due course, reached the Tower, but only two-thirds
of the amount were paid. Mr. Price naturally remonstrated;
but as the proceeding seems not to have been
unusual, the Board took no notice. So the injured gunner
petitioned the Queen, and a courteous letter from the Treasury
speedily reached the Tower, in which a nice distinction
was drawn between Mr. Price's case and that of the merchants,
who had been similarly treated, "who had been great
gainers as well by the exchange as by the stores and
provisions which they had sold." The Board admitted the
force of the reasoning, and the creditor got his own again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The duties of the storekeeper are expressed by his title,
and involved close and frequent personal inspection of stores,
as well as great clerical labour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Clerk of the Deliveries had to draw all proportions for
delivering any stores, and to keep copies of all orders or
warrants for the proportions, and journals vouched by the
persons who indented for them. He had to compare monthly
the indents taken for all deliveries of stores with the Storekeeper's
proportions; and had to attend, either in person or
represented by one of his sworn clerks, at all deliveries of
stores, and when taking <em>remains</em> of ships.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The Treasurer of the Ordnance, who had to find heavy
personal securities, was one of the most important of the
remaining officers attached to the Board.</p>

<p class='c000'>So much for the individual duties of the principal officers
of the Ordnance, duties which, it must be admitted, were
generally well and conscientiously performed. Their acts,
in their collective capacity, are more open to criticism.
Although the Master-General could act independently of the
Board, when he chose, and had full power of dismissing or
suspending any of the officers, reporting the same to the
Sovereign, he generally worked by means of the Board and,
with his consent, their acts were perfectly legal and binding
without his presence. His personal influence appeared chiefly
in matters of patronage and promotion, and, after the foundation
of the Royal Military Academy, it appeared in a very
marked way in all matters connected with its government.
But, with these exceptions, the actions of the Board which
were most public, and call for most comment, are those which
are to be traced to it in its collective capacity; and, as we
shall see in the course of this History, their joint acts were
often characterized by a pettiness, a weakness, and a blindness
worthy of the most wooden-headed vestry of the
nineteenth century. It is marvellous how frequently men
who, when acting by themselves, display the utmost zeal
and the strongest sense of responsibility, lose both when
associated with others for joint action, where their individuality
is concealed. The zeal seems instantly to evaporate:
their sense of justice gets blunted by the traditions of the
Board of which they have become members; and even
the most radical—after a few useless kicks and plunges—soon
settles into the collar, and assists the team to drag on
the lumbering vehicle of obstruction and unreason. The
power over a Board which is exercised by its permanent
clerks is not the less tyranny because it is adroitly exercised,
or because the tyrants are necessary evils. If an <em>individual</em>
is put at the head of a department, self-esteem assists a
sense of duty in making him master the details, and ensure
the proper working of the machine. But when he finds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>himself merely one of several shifting and shadowy units
whose individualities are lost, and whose faults are visited
upon an empty abstraction instead of on themselves, he
speedily in mere sympathy becomes like them; and, like
them, he bows to the customs and precedents quoted by the
permanent officials with an ill-disguised contempt for those
to whom these precedents are unfamiliar. Then follows the
unresisting signature of documents placed before the Board
by clerks who have no idea of anything beyond their office
walls—who imagine the world was created for them, not they
for the world, and who believe and almost say, that the very
members of the Board are there merely to be the channels of
their offensive and dictatorial opinions. There has been in
all ages in this country an officialism which cannot look
beyond the letter of the law, whose representatives decline
to enter into argument, to consider the circumstances of a
case, or to make allowance for emergencies:—whose minds
prefer sinning in a groove to doing right out of it: and
whose conduct would often appear malicious, were not malice
too active a feeling to enter into their cold and contracted
bosoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>This officialism was often rampant in the Ordnance; nor
with the extinction of that Honourable Board can it be said
to have vanished from England's administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in the history of every corporation, there were at the
Ordnance fits of economy and extravagance. The extravagance
always began at the Tower, the centre of the Board's
official centre and kingdom; the economy away at the
circumference, among poor gunners at distant stations,
among decaying barracks and fortifications crying out loudly
for repair. It seems destined to be the motto of departments
in every age, "Charity begins at home: economy
abroad." After the peace of Utrecht, there was a determined
resolution on the part of the Government to retrench,—a
wise and praiseworthy resolution, if the method to be
adopted were judicious. The Treasury communicated with
the Ordnance: and the Tower having made plausible promises
to Whitehall, the Honourable Board met to see what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>could be done. Starting with the official postulate, so characteristic
of English departments, that their own salaries
were to be untouched, the field of their labour was in
proportion contracted. Ultimately they decided to economize
in Scotland: they reduced all the stores there; voted
no money for the repair of the fortifications or barracks;
and, regardless of past services, they reduced the gunners
in various garrisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the far north a plaintive appeal meets the student's
eye. It is from one John Murray, who had been Master-Gunner
of Fort William for nineteen years, and who in this
fit of economy had been ruthlessly struck off the establishment.
Verily, ere many months be over, honest John shall have his
revenge!</p>

<p class='c000'>From Scotland, the Board turned to the Colonies, and
reminded them that they must pay for their own engineers
and gunners, if they wished to keep them. A committee
sat to inquire how the American dependencies could be made
to pay for themselves,—the beginning of that official irritation
which culminated in the blaze in which we lost them
altogether; and in the mean time demands for stores were
neglected. One unhappy Governor wrote that he had under
his command a company of troops which for fifteen years had
received no fresh bedding: and "many of the soldiers were
very ill, and in y<sup>e</sup> winter ready to starve." A special
messenger was sent to lay the matter before the Board; but,
he having been recalled by domestic reasons before succeeding
in his prayer, the Board adroitly pigeon-holed his petition
for four years; and, in the language of a subsequent letter,
"For want of bedding, many of y<sup>e</sup> soldiers have since
perished."</p>

<p class='c000'>But ere long came the inevitable swing in the other
direction. Queen Anne died; King George had not yet
landed at Greenwich; there was agitation and conspiracy
among the adherents of the Stuarts, and Scotland was
simmering with rebellion. Then did the fearful Privy Council
send letter after letter to the Ordnance urging them to find
arms for 10,000 men for Scotland, or for 5000, or even for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>4000; but from their diminished stores even this small body
could with difficulty be armed. A train of artillery was
ordered to march, and could not: everything was starved,
and in chaos; and its commander, Albert Borgard, wrote,
"Things are in such confusion as cannot be described."
Orders were sent to man and defend Fort William, the now
desolate scene of John Murray's nineteen years; and General
Maitland, on reaching it, reported that "the parapets want
repairing: there are no palisadoes; without an engineer to
help me, I can but make the best of a bad bargain." He
had to advance the money himself: "Who pays me," he
wrote, "I know not." By next messenger he asked for a
little gunpowder, a few spades, pickaxes, and wheelbarrows,
all rather useful articles in a fortification, but which had
vanished under the breath of economy. There were no
gunners, he wrote, to work the guns; and he requested that
the hand-grenades which were coming from Edinburgh
might be filled and fitted with fuzes before they should be
sent to him, "for we have none here that understand this
matter well." Of a truth, John Murray had his revenge!</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal gate of the fortress was so rotten and
shattered that it could not be made use of, and was of no
defence at all. There never had been any gate, the General
wrote, to the port of the ravelin; and unless the platform
could be renewed, it would be impossible to work the guns.
"And," he adds in a well-rounded period, "the old timber
houses in which the officers of the Garrison are lodged,
and also the old timber chapell, are all in such a shattered
pitifull condition, that neither the first can be lodged
in one, nor the Garrison attend divine service in the
other without being exposed to the inconvenience of all
weathers."</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was General Maitland singular. From Dumbarton
Castle Lord Glencairn wrote to the Board, "We not only
want in a manner everything, but we have not so much as a
boat. And, besides, the Garrison wants near four months'
pay." From Carlisle the Governor wrote that there were
only four barrels of powder in the garrison, a deficiency of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>every species of stores, and only four gunners, "three of
which are superannuated." Most of the gun-carriages were
unserviceable, and the platforms wanted repairing. There
was haste and panic at Portsmouth, as empty stores and
unarmed ships warned the Board what work there was before
them. And from Chester, Mr. Asheton, the zealous governor
just appointed, reported, "The guns are all here, but not the
carriages, so that the stores, &amp;c., would be of service—not
prejudice—to an enemy." The only men there who were
capable of doing any work were forty <em>invalids</em>; and he therefore
begged for assistance in men and stores, "in order" he
wrote, "that I may be capable of doing my country service
by maintaining the rights of our gracious Sovereign King
George against all Popish Pretenders whatsoever."</p>

<p class='c000'>As the guns of the Tower blazed out their welcome to the
King, the smoke must have clouded over such an accumulation
of testimony in the Ordnance offices hard by, proving
that there may be an economy which is no economy at all,
as might almost have penetrated the intelligence of a Board.
This period in the history of the Ordnance is unsurpassed,
even by the many blundering times which, in the course of
these volumes, we shall have to examine, down to that day
in the year of grace 1855 when, "from the first Cabinet at
which Lord Palmerston ever sat as Premier, the Secretary
at War brought home half a sheet of paper, containing a
memorandum that the Ordnance—one of the oldest Constitutional
departments of the Monarchy ... was to be
abolished."<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the early days of the Ordnance Board, its relations
with the navy were more intimate than in later years. The
gunners of the ships were under its control, and had to
answer to it for the expenditure of their stores. In this particular,
as in most details of checking and audit, the Board
was stern to a degree, and not unfrequently unreasonable.
In 1712, the captain of a man-of-war, sent to Newfoundland
in charge of a convoy, found the English inhabitants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the Island in a state of great danger and uneasiness, and
almost unprotected. At their urgent request, he left with
them much of his ordnance and stores before he returned to
England. With the promptitude which characterized the
Board's action towards any one who dared to think for himself,
it refused to pass the captain's or gunner's accounts,
nor would it authorize them to draw their pay. Remonstrance
was useless; explanations were unattended to: the
lesson had to be taught to its subordinates, however harshly
and idiotically, that freewill did not belong to them, and
that to assume any responsibility was to commit a grievous
sin. It actually required a petition to the Queen and the
Treasury before the unhappy men could get a hearing, and,
as a natural consequence, an approval and confirmation of
their conduct.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arming of all men-of-war belonged to the Ordnance;
indeed, the office was created for the Navy, although, in
course of time, Army details almost entirely monopolized it.
Although obliged to act on the requisitions of the Lord
High Admiral, their control in their own details, and over the
gunners of the ship as regarded their stores, was unfettered.
The repairing of the ships, and to a considerable extent
their internal fittings, were part of the Board's duties; but
it is to be hoped that the technical knowledge of some of
their officials exceeded that possessed by the Masters-General.
A letter is extant from one of these distinguished
individuals, written on board the 'Katherine' yacht, in 1682,
to his loving friends, the principal officers of the Ordnance.
"I desire" he wrote, "you would give Mr. Young notice to
proceed no further in making y<sup>e</sup> hangings for y<sup>e</sup> great
bedstead in y<sup>e</sup> lower room in y<sup>e</sup> Katherine yacht, till ye
have directions from me."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Naval branch of the Board's duties is beyond the
province of the present work. Of the Military branch much
will be better described in the chapters concerning the old
Artillery trains, the Royal Military Academy, and in the
general narrative of the Royal Artillery's existence as a
regiment. A few words, however, may be said here with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>reference to their civil duties, once of vast importance, but,
with the naval branch, swallowed up, like the fat kine of
Pharaoh's dream, by the military demands which were constantly
on the increase, and were fostered by the military
predilections of the Masters and Lieutenants-General.</p>

<p class='c000'>The civil duties have been well and clearly defined by
Clode in his 'Military Forces of the Crown,' vol. ii. He
divides into duties—1. As to Stores; 2. As Landowners;
3. As to the Survey of the United Kingdom; 4. As to
Defensive Works; 5. As to Contracts; and 6. As to Manufacturing
Establishments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the first of these it may be said that their system was
excellent. Periodical remains were taken (the oldest extant
being dated April, 1559), and a system of issues and receipts
was in force which could hardly be improved upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their capacity as Landowners, the members of the
Board were good and cautious stewards; but as buyers of
land, their characteristic crops up of thinking but little
of other men's feelings or convenience. Perhaps their line of
action in this respect can be best illustrated by an anecdote
which comes down over many years in the shape of an indignant
and yet pitiful remonstrance. It was in good Queen
Anne's time, and the Board had formed a scheme for fortifying
Portsmouth. They appointed Commissioners to arrange
the situation of the various works, and to come to terms with
the landowners. These gentlemen did their duty; and,
among others, one James Dixon was warned that some land
on which he had recently built a brewhouse would be
required for the Board's purposes. A jury was empanelled,
and assessed the value of the whole at 4000<em>l.</em> When James
Dixon built his brewhouse, he had borrowed money on
mortgage: the interest would, he believed, be easily paid,
and the principal of the debt gradually reduced by the
earnings of the brewery. But after the jury sat, not a drop
of beer was brewed: no orders could be taken, with the fear
hanging over him that he must turn out at any moment;
nor could he introduce additional improvements or fixtures
after the assessment had been made, as he would never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>receive a farthing for them over the first valuation. Little
knowing the admirable system of official management in
which an English department excels, he sat waiting for the
purchase-money. One month passed after another: Christmas
came, and yet another, and another, and the only knocks
at James Dixon's door were from the angry creditor demanding
his money. At last, after waiting four years,—the grey
hairs thickening on the unhappy brewer's head,—the knock
of a lawyer's writ came; and before the Master of the Rolls
his miserable presence and story were alike demanded. The
narrative ends abruptly with a petition from him for six
months' grace. Even then hope was not dead in him; and
he babbled in his prayer that "he was in hopes by this time
"to have redeemed it out of the 4000<em>l.</em> agreed to be paid
y<sup>r</sup> Petitioner as aforesaid."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of our story we shall find many such lives
crushed beneath the wheels of an official Juggernaut. Alas!
that Juggernaut is still a god!</p>

<p class='c000'>'The Survey of the United Kingdom' will be the most
honourable vehicle for transmitting to posterity the story of
the Board's existence; for, although not yet completed, to the
Board is due the credit of originating a work whose national
value can hardly be over-estimated. The defensive works
erected under the Ordnance already live almost in history,
so rapidly has the science of fortification had to move to keep
pace with the strength of attack. Their contracts showed
but little favouritism, and, on the whole, were just: they
included everything, from the building of forts to the manufacture
of gunpowder and small arms; and, in peace and war,
they reached nearly over the whole civilized world. With
this extensive area came the necessity for representatives of
the Board at the various stations,—who were first, and wisely,
civilians, three in number; afterwards, most foolishly, owing
to the increasing military element at the Board, two soldiers,
the commanding officers of Artillery and Engineers, and one
civilian. And as no man can serve two masters, it was soon
apparent that the military members could not always serve
their local General and their absent Board; discipline was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>not unfrequently strained; jealousy and ill-will supervened;
and when the death of the Board sounded the knell of the
Respective officers, as they were termed, there can be no
doubt that it removed an anomaly which was also a danger.
Under the new and existing system, the commanding officers
of Artillery and Engineers occupy their proper places: they
are now the advisers of their General, not his critics: and
the door is opened for the entry of the officers of the scientific
corps upon an arena where civilian traditions are unknown
or powerless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the manufacturing departments of the Ordnance, what
has to be said will come better in its place in the course of
the narrative.</p>

<p class='c000'>In summing up, not so much the contents of this Chapter,
which is necessarily brief, as the study of the Board's history,
the following are the ideas presented to the student's mind:—The
Board of Ordnance formed a standard of political
excellence,—which it endeavoured to follow when circumstances
permitted,—of financial and economical excellence,
which it planted everywhere among its subordinates for
worship, but which was not allowed the same adoration in its
own offices in the Tower. It saved money to the country
legitimately by an admirable system of check and audit—illegitimately
too often by a false economy, which in the
end proved no economy at all; it obstructed our Generals
in war, and hampered them in peace: it was extravagant on
its own members and immediate retainers to an extent which
can only be realized by those who study the evidence given
before the Parliamentary Commission of 1810-11. Jobbery
existed, but rarely secret or underhand; and its extensive
patronage was, on the whole, well and fairly exercised. And
although every day shows more clearly the wisdom of removing
from under the control of a Board that part of our army,
the importance of which is made more apparent by every war
which occurs, yet the Artilleryman must always remember
with kindly interest that it was to this board and its great
Master (Marlborough) that his Regiment owes its existence,
that to it we owe a nurture which was sometimes too detailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and careful, but under which we earned a reputation in many
wars; and that, after a long peace, it placed in the Crimea,
for one of the greatest and most difficult sieges in history,—difficult
for other reasons than mere military,—the finest
siege-train of Artillery that the world has ever seen. In
command of the English Army, during this war, the Board's
last Master died; and in the list which preceded him, and
with which this chapter closes, will be found names which
would almost atone for the worst offences ever committed by
the Board over which their owners presided.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>List of the Masters-General of the Ordnance.</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>The most recent list of these distinguished officials is that
published in Kane's 'List of Officers of the Royal Artillery.'
In it all the Masters before the reign of Henry VIII. are
ignored, as being merely commanders of the Artillery on
expeditions or in districts. But this seems somewhat stern
ruling. Undoubtedly Henry VIII. reorganized the Ordnance
Department, and defined the position of the Master, as never
had been done before, and the sequence of the Masters from
his reign is clear and intelligible. But before his time there
were not merely Masters of the Ordnance on particular expeditions,
but also for life; and there were certainly Offices of
the Ordnance in the Tower. It has, therefore, been thought
advisable in the following list to prefix a few names, which
seem deserving of being included, although omitted in
'Kane's List.'</p>

<p class='c000'>The earliest of whom there is any record is</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Rauf Bigod</span>, who was appointed on 2nd June, 1483, "for
life." His life does not, however, seem to have been a very
long one, for we find</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Richard Gyleford</span>, who was appointed in 1485.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Sampson Norton</span> was undoubtedly Master of the
Ordnance, appointed in 1513, as has been proved by extant
MSS.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next one about whom there is any certainty would
appear to be the one who heads 'Kane's List'—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Sir <span class='sc'>Thomas Seymour</span>, who was appointed about 1537.
Other lists show Sir Christopher Morris as Master at this
time; but there seems little doubt that he was merely Lieutenant
of the Ordnance, although a distinguished soldier,
and frequently in command of the Artillery on service.</p>

<p class='c000'>If one may credit 'Dugdale's Baronage,' the next in order
was</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Thomas Darcie</span> (afterwards Baron Darcie), appointed
in 1545: but if so, he merely held it for a short time, for we
find him succeeded by</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Philip Hoby</span>, who was appointed in 1548.</p>

<p class='c000'>'Grose's List' and others interpolate Sir Francis Fleming,
as having been appointed in 1547; but this is undoubtedly
an error, and his name wisely rejected by the author of
'Kane's List,' where it is placed, as it should be, in the list of
Lieutenants of the Ordnance. There is a folio of Ordnance
accounts still in existence, extending over the period between
29th March, 1547, and the last day of June, 1553, signed by
Sir Francis Fleming, as <em>Lieutenant</em> of the Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next in rotation in the best lists is</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Richard Southwell</span>, Knight, shown by 'Kane's List' as
appointed in February, 1554, and, by certain indentures and
Ordnance accounts which are still extant, as being Master of
the Ordnance, certainly in 1557 and 1558.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next Master held the appointment for many years.
He was</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ambrose Dudley</span>, Earl of Warwick, and can be proved
from indentures in the possession of the late Craven Ord,
Esq., which are probably still in existence, and from which
extracts were made in 1820 by the compiler of a manuscript
now in the Royal Artillery Library, to have been appointed
on the 19th February, 1559, and to have held the office until
21st February, 1589, over thirty years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Possibly owing to the difficulty of finding any one ready to
undertake the duties of one who had had so much experience—a
difficulty which occurred more than once again—the office
was placed in commission after 1589, probably until 1596.
From 'Burghleigh's State Papers' we learn that the Commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>were, the <span class='sc'>Lord Treasurer</span>, the <span class='sc'>Lord High
Admiral</span>, the <span class='sc'>Lord Chamberlain</span>, and <span class='sc'>Vice-Chamberlain
Sir J. Fortescue</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>On 19th March, 1596, <span class='sc'>Robert, Earl of Essex</span>, was appointed
Master of the Ordnance, and held the appointment
until removed by Elizabeth, in 1600. No record of a successor
occurs until the 10th September, 1603, when</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Charles, Earl of Devonshire</span>, was appointed. He died
in 1606, and was succeeded by</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Lord Carew</span>, appointed Master-General throughout England,
for life, in 1608. He was created Earl of Totnes in
1625, and died in 1629. From a number of Ordnance warrants
and letters still extant, there can be no doubt that he
held the office until his death. For a year after, until 5th
March, 1630, we learn, from the Harleian Manuscripts, that
there was no Master-General. On that date</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Howard Lord Vere</span> was appointed, and held office until
the 2nd September, 1634, when</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Mountjoy, Earl of Newport</span>, was appointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the troubles in England—the Revolution, the
Commonwealth, and at last the Restoration. Lord Newport
seems to have remained Master-General the whole time; for
on Charles II. coming to the throne, he issued directions
specifying, "Forasmuch as the Earl of Newport may, by
Letters Patent from our Royal Father, pretend to the office
of our Ordnance, We, for weighty reasons, think fit to
suspend him from said charge, or anything belonging
thereto; and Our Will is that you prepare the usual Bill
for his suspension."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 22nd January, 1660, a most able Master-General
was appointed, whose place the King afterwards found it
most difficult to fill. He was</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>William Compton</span>, Knight, and he remained in office
until his death. By letters patent, on the 21st October,
1664, specifying that he had not determined with himself to
supply the place of office of his Master of the Ordnance, then
void by the death of Sir William Compton, and considering
the importance of his affairs at that time to have that service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>well provided for, the King appointed as Commissioners to
execute the office of Master of the Ordnance</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt><span class='sc'>John, Lord Berkly of Stratton</span>,</dt>
    <dd>}
    </dd>
    <dt>Sir <span class='sc'>John Duncombe</span>, Knight, and</dt>
    <dd>}
    </dd>
    <dt><span class='sc'>Thomas Chicheley</span>.</dt>
    <dd>}
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>This Commission lasted until the 4th June, 1670, when
the last-named Commissioner (now Sir <span class='sc'>Thomas Chicheley</span>,
Knight), was appointed Master of the Ordnance, and in the
warrant for his appointment, which is now in the Tower
Library, there is a recapitulation of the names of previous
Masters, which includes one—placed between Sir Richard
Southwell and the Earl of Essex—which does not appear in
any other list, but which one would gladly see included—</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Philip Sidney</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the death of Sir Thomas Chicheley, the office was
again placed in Commission, the incumbents being</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>John Chicheley</span>, son of the late Master,</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>William Hickman</span>, and</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <span class='sc'>Christopher Musgrave</span>, the last-named of whom afterwards
became Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance. This
Commission lasted from 1679 to 8th January, 1682, when the
celebrated</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span class='sc'>George, Lord Dartmouth</span>," became Master, having held
the office of Lieutenant-General under the Commission from
1st July, 1679, as plain Colonel George Legge. He remained
in office until after the Revolution of 1688, when he forfeited
it for his adherence to the King. His successor, appointed
by William III. in 1689, and afterwards killed at the Battle
of the Boyne, rejoiced in the following sounding titles:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Frederick, Duke de Schomberg</span>, Marquis of Harwich,
Earl of Brentford, Baron of Teys, General of their Majesties'
Forces, Master-General of their Majesties' Ordnance, Knight
of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Count of the Holy
Roman Empire, Grandee of Portugal, General of the Duke
of Brandenburg's forces, and Stadtholder of Prussia.</p>

<p class='c000'>After his death, the Master-Generalship remained vacant
until July, 1693, when it was conferred upon</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Henry, Viscount Sidney</span>, afterwards Earl of Romney, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>held it until 1702. He was succeeded, almost immediately
on Queen Anne's accession, by her favourite, the great</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>John, Earl of Marlborough</span>, who held the appointment
until he fell into disgrace with the Queen, when he resigned
it, with his other appointments, on 30th December, 1711.
He was succeeded by</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Richard, Earl Rivers</span>, who, after six months, was followed,
on 29th August, 1712, according to the British
Chronologist, or on the 1st July, 1712, according to Kane's
List, by</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>James, Duke of Hamilton</span>, who was killed in a duel in
November of the same year.</p>

<p class='c000'>For two years the appointment remained vacant, but in
1714 it was again conferred upon</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>John</span>, now <span class='sc'>Duke of Marlborough</span>, who held it until his
death, in 1722. He was succeeded, as follows, by</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>William, Earl of Cadogan</span>, on 22nd June, 1722, and by</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>John, Duke of Argyle and Greenwich</span>, on 3rd June
1725.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this period there is an unaccountable confusion among
the various authorities. The 'British Chronologist' and the
'Biographia Britannica' make the list run as follows:—The
Duke of Argyle and Greenwich was succeeded, in 1740, by
John, Duke of Montague, and resumed office again, for three
weeks, in 1742, when, for the last time, he resigned all his
appointments, being again succeeded by the same Duke of
Montague, who continued to hold the office until 1749, when
he died.</p>

<p class='c000'>'Grose's List,' on the other hand, makes the Duke of Argyle's
tenure of office expire in 1730, instead of 1740, and makes
no allusion to his brief resumption of the appointment in
1742, and 'Kane's List' has followed this. It is possible
that for the brief period that he was in office the second
time, no letters patent were issued for his appointment,
which would account for its omission in most lists; but the
difference of ten years in the duration of the first appointment
is more difficult to account for. There is no doubt
that, in 1740, the Duke of Argyle resigned all his appointments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>for the first time, but it is not stated whether the
Master-Generalship was one, although it has been assumed.
On the other hand, he might have been away during these
ten years to a great extent, or allowed his officers of the
Ordnance to sign warrants, thus giving an impression to the
casual student that he no longer held office. The manuscript
in the Royal Artillery Library, already referred to,
bears marks of such careful research, that one is disposed to
adopt its reading of the difficulty, which is different from
that taken by Grose's and Kane's Lists, and agrees with the
other works mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the death of the Duke of Montague, the office
remained vacant until the end of 1755, when it was conferred
upon</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Charles, Duke of Marlborough</span>, who held it until his
death, on 20th October, 1758.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the vacancy immediately preceding the appointment
of the last-named Master-General, Sir J. Ligonier had
been appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, and for
four years had performed the duties of both appointments,—acted
as Colonel of the Royal Artillery, and Captain of the
Cadet Company. A few months after the death of the Duke
of Marlborough—namely, on the 3rd July, 1759—he was
appointed Master-General, being by this time</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Field-Marshal Viscount Ligonier.</span> He was succeeded,
on the 14th May, 1763, by</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>John, Marquis Granby</span>, who held it until 17th January,
1770, when we find that he resigned all his appointments,
except the command of the Blues. For nearly two years the
office remained vacant, and on the 1st October, 1772, it was
conferred upon</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>George, Viscount Townshend</span>, whose tenure of office extended
over nearly the whole of that anxious period in
the history of England which included such episodes as the
American War of Independence and the great Siege of
Gibraltar. The sequence of the remaining Masters may be
taken from Kane's List, and is as follows:—</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> term Ordnance was in use in England before cannon
were employed; and it included every description of
warlike weapon. The artificers employed in the various permanent
military duties were called officers of the Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first record of cannon having been used in the field
dates from Henry III.; and with the increasing skill of the
founders the use of cannon speedily became more general.
But the moral influence of the guns was far beyond their
deserts. They were served in the rudest way, and their
movements in the field and in garrison were most uncertain,
yet they were regarded with superstitious awe, and received
special names, such as "John Evangelist," the "Red Gun,"
the "Seven Sisters," "Mons Meg," &amp;c. In proportion to
the awe which they inspired was the inadequate moral effect
produced on an army by the loss of its artillery, or by the
capture of its enemy's guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the earliest days cannon were made of the rudest
materials,—of wood, leather, iron bars, and hoops; but as
time went on guns of superior construction were imported
from France and Holland. The first mention of the casting
in England of "great brass cannon and culverins" is in the
year 1521, when one John Owen began to make them, "the
first Englishman that ever made that kind of Artillery in
England." The first iron guns cast in this country were
made by three foreigners at Buckstead in Sussex, in the
year 1543. In this same year, the first shells were cast, for
mortars of eleven inches calibre, described as "certain hollow
shot of cast iron, to be stuffed with fireworks, whereof
the bigger sort had screws of iron to receive a match,
and carry fire to break in small pieces the same hollow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>shot, whereof the smallest piece hitting a man would kill
or spoil him." The following table<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> gives the names,
weights, and charges of the guns which were in general use
in the year 1574. There were, in addition to these, guns
called Curtals or Curtaux, Demicurtaux, and Bombards:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the earliest occasions recorded of the use of Artillery
by the English, were the campaigns in Scotland of
Edward II. and Edward III.; the capture of Berwick by
the latter monarch in 1333; his campaigns in Flanders and
France in 1338-39-40; his siege of Vannes in 1343; his
successful raid in Normandy in 1346; the battle of Cressy
on the 26th August in that year, when the fire of his few
pieces of cannon is said to have struck a panic into the
enemy; the expedition to Ireland in 1398; Henry IV.'s
defeat of the French in Wales, in 1400; another successful
siege of Berwick in 1405; the capture of Harfleur in 1415;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and the battle of Agincourt on the 25th October of that
year; the sieges of Tongue and Caen in 1417; of Falaise
and other towns in Normandy in 1418; concluding with
the capitulation of Cherbourg and Rouen after protracted
sieges, stone projectiles being thrown from the cannon with
great success; the engagements between Edward IV. and
Warwick, when Artillery was used on both sides; the expedition
to France in 1474, and to Scotland in 1482, when yet
another successful siege of Berwick took place, successful
mainly owing to the Artillery employed by the besieging
force; the capture of Sluis, in Flanders; and the attack on
Calais and Boulogne in 1491. In the sixteenth century may
be enumerated the expedition to Flanders in 1511, in aid of
the Duchess of Savoy; the Siege of Térouenne and Battle
of the Spurs in 1513; the Siege of Tournay; the Battle of
Flodden Field, where the superior accuracy of the English
Artillery rendered that of the Scotch useless; the descent
on the coast of France and capture of Morlies in 1523; the
Siege of Bray and Montedier in 1524; the siege of Boulogne
in 1544; the expedition to Cadiz under the Earl of Essex in
1596, and that to the Azores in 1597. In the next century,
daring the Civil War, and in all Cromwell's expeditions, the
use of Artillery was universal; and the part of the century
after the Restoration will be alluded to in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The use, therefore, of Artillery by the English has existed
for centuries; but,—regarding it with modern eyes, its application
would better deserve the term <em>abuse</em>. Nothing strikes
the student so much as the absence of the scientific Artillery
element in the early trains; and this feeling is followed
by one of wonder at the patience with which our military
leaders tolerated the almost total want of mobility
which characterized them. Not until the last decade of the
eighteenth century was the necessity of mobility officially
recognized, by the establishment of the Royal Horse Artillery;
and it took half a century more to impress upon our
authorities that a Field Battery might not unreasonably be
expected to move occasionally faster than a walk.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>It is difficult, in reviewing such a period as the last fifteen
years have been in the history of Artillery in England—so
full of improvements in every way—to single out any one of
these as more worthy of mention than the rest; but when
posterity comes to review it dispassionately, the improvement
in equipment and mobility of our Field Artillery will
most probably be considered the prominent feature of the
time. And these are the very qualities which for centuries
remained in England unimproved and stagnant. The
eighteenth century saw Artillery conducted by drivers, not
under military discipline, nor marked by distinctive costume;
who not unfrequently fled with their horses during the
action, leaving the gunners helpless, and the guns at the
mercy of the enemy. In this year, 1872, our drivers go into
action unarmed, it being considered that the possession of
defensive weapons might distract their attention from their
horses. But we do not commit the old error of using men
not under martial law. A driver who, on an emergency,
finds himself with his whip merely to defend him, may
possibly feel aggrieved: but however far he may run away,
he cannot escape the embrace of the Mutiny Act, and is as
liable to punishment as the man who deserts before the
enemy, after his country has sent him into the field armed
from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the very earliest days of Artillery in England, the
number of gunners borne on permanent pay on the books
of the Ordnance bore a very small proportion to the artificers
so borne. With the increasing use of cannon, an
increase in the number of artillerymen took place, but by
no means <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</span></i>: and, as towns in England became
gradually fortified, a small number of gunners in each was
found to be necessary to protect and take care of the stores,
and to fire the guns on high days and holidays. In 1344,
although no fewer than 321 artificers and engineers were
borne on the books of the Ordnance in time of peace, only
twelve gunners and seven armourers appear. In 1415, at
the Siege of Harfleur, there were present 120 miners, 130
carpenters, and 120 masons; but only 25 master, and 50
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>servitor gunners—the latter corresponding probably to the
matrosses of a later date. At the Siege of Tongue, in 1417,
no less than 1000 masons, carpenters, and labourers were
present, but only a small number of gunners. At this
time, the driving of the guns, the placing them in position,
and shipping and unshipping them, devolved on the civil
labourers of the trains, and there was a military guard to
escort the guns on the march. The gunner's duty seems to
have been a general supervision of gun and stores, and the
laying and firing it when in action. He was the captain of
the gun in war—its custodian in peace. After the fifteenth
century there was a marked increase in the number of artillerymen
in the trains, although still totally inadequate. For
example, in the train ordered on service in France, in 1544,
where the civil element was represented by 157 artificers,
100 pioneers, and 20 carters, there were no less than
2 master-gunners, 264 gunners, and a special detachment
of 15 gunners, for the guns placed immediately round the
King's tent. The principal officers of the Ordnance also
accompanied the expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a distinction between the gunners of garrisons
and those of the trains, as regarded the source of their pay,
or rather its channel. At first, both were paid from the
Exchequer; but after the proper establishment of an
Ordnance Department at the Tower, the gunners of the
various trains were paid by it, the others receiving their
salaries as before. The company of fee'd gunners at the
Tower of London differed from the gunners of other garrisons
in receiving their pay from the Ordnance directly. It
must not be imagined, however, that the gunners of garrisons
were beyond the control of the Board of Ordnance
because their pay was not drawn on the Ordnance books.
Not merely had the Master of the Ordnance the nomination
of the gunners of garrisons, but the power also of weeding
out the useless and superannuated. The instance given in
the Introductory Chapter of this volume, shows how directly
they were under the Board in matters of discipline; and
although, as a matter of Treasury detail, their pay was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>drawn in a different department, a word from the Ordnance
Office could stop its issue to any gunner in any garrison who
was deemed by the Board to have forfeited his right to it in
any way. It was not until 1771, long after the formation of
the Royal Artillery, that these garrison gunners were incorporated
into the invalid companies of the regiment; and at
the present date they are represented by what is called the
Coast Brigade of Artillery. The pay of the old gunners
of garrisons depended on the fort in which they resided.
Berwick, for example, as an important station, was also one
in which the gunner's pay was higher. In the reign of
Edward VI. we find the average pay of a master-gunner
was 1<em>s.</em> a-day, and of the gunners, from 4<em>d.</em> to 1<em>s.</em> Later,
the pay of the master-gunner was raised to 2<em>s.</em> a-day, and
that of the gunners rarely fell below 1<em>s.</em> In time of war,
the pay of the gunners of the trains far exceeded the above
rates. The senior master-gunner was styled the Master-Gunner
of England. From 2<em>s.</em> a-day, which was the pay
of this official in the sixteenth century, it rose to 160<em>l.</em>
per annum, and ultimately to 190<em>l.</em> His residence and
duties lay originally in the Tower, and chiefly among the
fee'd gunners at that station; but after Woolwich had attained
its speciality for Artillery details, quarters were allotted
to him there in the Manor House. Among the oldest
Master-Gunners of England whose names are recorded may
be enumerated Christopher Gould, Richard Webb, Anthony
Feurutter<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> or Fourutter,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Stephen Bull, William Bull,
William Hammond, John Reynold, and John Wornn—all of
whom held their appointments in the sixteenth century,
and the majority of them by letters patent from Elizabeth.
From the fact that in the wording of their appointments
two of the above are particularized as soldiers by profession,
it would appear that the others were not so; and it is more
probable that they were chosen for their knowledge of laboratory
duties, and of the "making of pleasaunt and warlike
fireworks."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The company of fee'd gunners at the Tower, which might
be supposed to have had some military organization, really
appears to have had little or none. Their number in
Edward VI.'s reign was 58, with a master-gunner; but
gradually it was increased to 100, which for many years
was the normal establishment. They were supposed to
parade twice a week, and learn the science of gunnery, under
the Master-Gunner of England; but their attendance was so
irregular, and their ignorance of their profession so deplorable,
that a strong measure had to be adopted, to which
allusion will be made in a later chapter. Colonel Miller, in
his researches among the warrants appointing the gunners,
found some venerable recruits—who can hardly have been of
much value in the field—of ages varying from sixty-four to
ninety-two. There is no doubt that these appointments
were frequently sold, or given in return for personal or
political services, without any regard to the capability of
the recipient. The clerks at the Ordnance Office had their
fees for preparing these men's warrants, whose wording of
the duties expected of the nominee must have frequently read
like a grotesque satire. The situations were desirable because
they did not interfere with the holders continuing to work
at their trades near the Tower; and if the gunners were
ordered to Woolwich for the purpose of mounting guns, or
shipping and unshipping stores, they received working pay in
addition to their regular salaries. It was from their ranks
that the vacancies among master-gunners and gunners of
garrisons were almost invariably filled.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a warlike expedition had been decided upon, the
Master of the Ordnance was informed what size of a train
of Artillery was required; but he was permitted to increase
or decrease its internal proportions as he thought fit. To
him also was left the appointment of all the officers and
attendants of the train; and, with the exception of any
belonging to the small permanent establishment, it was
understood that the services of any so appointed were only
required while the expedition lasted. This spasmodic
method of organizing the Artillery forces of this country was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>sufficient to account for the want of progress in the science
of gunnery, and the equipments of our trains, which is
apparent until we reach the commencement of the eighteenth
century. But it took centuries of stagnation, and of bitter
and shameful experience, to teach the lesson that Artillery
is a science which requires incessant study, that such study
cannot be expected unless from men who can regard their
profession as a permanent one, and the study as a means to
an end; and that, even admitting the possibility of such
study being carried on by men in the hope of occasional
employment, it would be too theoretical, unless means of
practice and testing were afforded, beyond the power of a
private individual to obtain. Nor could habits of discipline
be generated by occasional military expeditions, which, to an
untrained man, are more likely to bring demoralization; it is
during peace-service that the discipline is learnt which is to
steady a man in the excitement and hardships of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>As samples of the trains of Artillery before the Restoration,
the following, of various dates, may be taken: and an
examination of the constituent parts will well repay the
reader.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first is a train in the year 1544, already alluded to,
and which was commanded by the Master of the Ordnance
himself, Sir Thomas Seymour.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5, the Artillery
element is alone given. Nor are the proportions of
the trains, and their constituent parts, such as to enable us
to draw any fixed law from them. They are merely interesting—not
very instructive. Table 1, on the other hand, is
both interesting <em>and</em> instructive. The appearance of medical
officers in the train of 1618, and of matrosses—a species
of assistant-gunner—in that of 1639, will not have escaped
the reader's notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the next chapter we shall find that the presence of a
man like Lord Dartmouth, and his predecessor, Sir William
Compton, at the Ordnance, reveals itself in the greater
method visible in the Artillery arrangements; and with the
introduction of Continental artillerists, under William III.,
comes a greater experience of the value of Artillery, which
nearly brought about, in 1698, that permanent establishment
which was delayed by circumstances until 1716.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> first step, of course, on the restoration of Charles II.,
was to undo everything in the Ordnance, and remove
every official bearing the mark of the Protectorate. Having
filled the vacant places with his own nominees, he seemed to
consider his duty done, and, with one exception, the official
history of the Ordnance for the next few years was a blank.
The exception was the Company of Gunners at the Tower,
which from 52, in 1661, rose to 90 in the following year, 98
in 1664, and then the old normal number 100.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the work in the Department done by the Master-General,
Sir William Compton, although not of a demonstrative
character, was good and useful, and prepared the
way for the reformations introduced by his more able successor,
Lord Dartmouth. The Master-Gunners of England
were now chosen from a higher social grade than before. In
1660 Colonel James Weymes held the appointment, followed
in 1666 by Captain Valentine Pyne, and in 1677 by Captain
Richard Leake. A new appointment was created for Captain
Martin Beckman—that of Chief Firemaster. His skill in his
department was rewarded by knighthood, and he held the
appointment, not merely until the Revolution of 1688, but
also under William III., having apparently overcome any
scruples as to deserting his former masters. A Surveyor-General
of the Ordnance, Jonas Moore by name, was appointed
in 1669, who afterwards received permission to
travel on the Continent to perfect himself in Artillery
studies, for which purpose he received the sum of 100<em>l.</em> a
year.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will observe the immense varieties of mortars,
and the large calibres, compared with those of the present
day. They were much used on board the bomb-vessels; but
it is difficult to see the advantage of so many small mortars,
varying so slightly in calibre.</p>

<p class='c000'>From an account of some new ordnance made in 1671, we
find that iron cannon of 7 were 10 feet long, and weighed
on an average 63 cwt., or 9½ feet long, and weighing from
54 cwt. to 60 cwts. Iron culverings of 10 feet in length
averaged 43 cwt. in weight, and demi-culverings of the same
length averaged in weight about 35 cwt. Iron falconetts
are mentioned 4 feet in length, and weighing from 300 to
312 lbs.</p>

on one occasion four iron demi-culverings, and three brass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>demi-cannon of 8½ feet long, with one brass culvering of 11½
feet. A more frequent present to that monarch was gunpowder,
or a quantity of muskets.</p>

<p class='c000'>The salutes in the Tower were fired from culverings and
8-pounders, and were in a very special manner under the
command of the Master-General himself. As little liberty
of thought was left to the subordinates at the Tower as
possible. Warnings of preparation were forwarded often
days before, followed at intervals by reminders that the
salute was not to be fired until a positive order should reach
the Tower from the Master-General.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letter-books at the Tower teem with correspondence
and orders on this subject, and the Master-General seemed
to write as many letters to his loving friends at the Tower
about a birthday salute, about which no mistake could well
occur, as he did about a salute of another kind, albeit a
birthday one, when on the 10th June, 1688, "it pleased
Almighty God, about ten o'clock of the morning, to bless
his Majesty and his Royal Consort, the Queen, with the
birth of a hopefull son, and his Majesty's kingdom and
dominions with a Prince: for which inestimable blessing"
public rejoicing was invited. It was a false tale which the
guns rang out from the Tower:—only a few months, and
the hopeful babe was a fugitive with its ill-fated father, and
remained an exile for his life.</p>

<p class='c014'>"He was indeed the most unfortunate of Princes, destined to
seventy-seven years of exile and wandering, of vain projects,
of honours more galling than insults, and hopes such as make
the heart sick."<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At this time, Woolwich was gradually increasing in importance
as an Artillery <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Depôt</span>, and in 1672 the beginning
of the Laboratory was laid, 70 feet long, "for receiving fireworks."</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1682 Lord Dartmouth was appointed Master-General,
and from this date until the Revolution the student of the
Ordnance MSS. recognizes the existence of a master-spirit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and a clear-headed man of business. In 1683 he obtained
authority from the King to reorganize the whole department,
and define the duties of every official—a task which he
performed so well that his work remained as the standard
rule for the Board until it ceased to exist. His physical
activity was as great as his mental: not a garrison in the
kingdom was safe from his personal inspection; and the
results of his examination were so eminently unsatisfactory
as to call forth orders which, while calculated to prevent,
had the effect also of revealing to posterity abuses of the
grossest description. Not merely was neglect discovered
among the storekeepers and gunners of the various garrisons—not
merely ignorance and incapacity—but it was
ascertained to be not unusual for a Master-Gunner to omit
reporting the death of his subordinates, while continuing
however to draw their pay. Lord Dartmouth's measures
comprised the weeding out of the incapable gunners; the
issue of stern warnings to all; the bringing the Storekeepers
(who had hitherto held their appointments by letters patent
from the Exchequer) under the immediate jurisdiction of
the Board of Ordnance; the increase of the more educated
element among the few Artillerymen on the permanent
establishment, by the appointment of Gentlemen of the
Ordnance, "lest the ready effects of our Artillery in any
respect may perhaps be wanting when occasion shall be
offered;" the appointment of Engineers to superintend the
fortifications, with salaries of 100<em>l.</em> a year, under a Chief
Engineer, Sir Bernard de Gomme; the encouragement of
foreign travel and study; and the creation of discipline
among the gunners at the Tower. Among the various causes
of regret which affected Lord Dartmouth after the Revolution,
probably none were more felt than the sorrow that he had
been unable to complete the reformation in the Ordnance
which he had so thoroughly and ably commenced.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a specimen of a train of Lord Dartmouth's time may be
taken the one ordered to march on 21st June, 1685, to join
Lord Feversham's force at Chippenham, and to proceed
against the rebels. It consisted of</p>

<p class='c000'>The guns used were brass Falcons and iron 3-pounders.</p>

<p class='c000'>On examining the comparative pay of the various ranks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the Provost-Marshal seems to be well paid, ranking as he
does in that respect with the Surgeon, and the Captain of
the Pioneers. But if we may judge of the discipline of his
train from one incident which has survived, his office can
have been no sinecure. We find on the 23rd December,
1685, the King and Privy Council assembled at Whitehall,
discussing gravely some conduct of certain members of the
train, which had formed matter of complaint and petition
from his Majesty's lieges. Four unhappy farmers had had
a yoke of oxen pressed from each—the day after the rebels
had been defeated—to bring off the carriages of the King's
train of Artillery (then immovable, as might have been
expected), and the animals had been made to travel as far as
Devizes, forty miles from their home. One of the farmers,
William Pope by name, had accompanied the train, in order
that he might bring the oxen back. On applying for them
at the end of the journey, the conductor "did abuse William
Pope, one of the petitioners, by threatening to hang him
for a rebel, as in the petition is more at large set forth."
So the farmers now prayed to have their oxen, with the
yokes and furniture, or their value, restored to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the King in Council was graciously pleased to refer the
complaint to Lord Dartmouth, with a view to justice being
done, the reader need not doubt that the petitioners went
away satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The details, contained in the Ordnance books, of the camp
ordered by the King in 1686 to be formed at Hounslow, give
the first intimation of that distribution of the Artillery of an
Army, known as Battalion guns, a system which lasted in
principle until 1871, although the guns ceased to be subdivided
in such small divisions a good many years before. As,
however, until 1871, the batteries had to accommodate themselves
to the movements of the battalions near them, it may
be said with truth that until then they were really Battalion
guns. James II. ordered fourteen regiments to encamp at
Hounslow with a view to overawing the disaffected part of
the populace; but the effect was to reveal instead the unmistakable
sympathy which existed between the troops and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>people; so the camp was abruptly broken up. The Battalion
guns were brass 3-pounders, under Gentlemen of the Ordnance,
with a few other attendants, and escorted <em>to their
places by the Grenadiers of the various Regiments</em>. Two demi-culverins
of 10 feet in length, and six small mortar pieces,
were also sent from the Tower to the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1687, uneasiness was felt about Ireland, and large
quantities of stores were assembled at Chester, for ready
transit to that country if required. A large issue of mortars
for that service was also made, the calibres being 14¼, 10, and
7 inches, and the diameters of the shells being respectively a
quarter of an inch less. Among other guns which occur by
name in the Ordnance lists of this year, and which have not yet
been mentioned, are culverin drakes of 8 feet in length; saker-drakes
of the same; and saker square guns also 8 feet long.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1688, his fatal year, King James was
advised by Lord Dartmouth to send a young Gentleman of
the Ordnance to Hungary to the Emperor's camp to improve
himself in the art military, "to observe and take notice
of their method of marching, encamping, embattling, exercising,
ordering their trains of Artillery, their manner
of approaching, besieging, or attacking any town, their
mines, Batteries, lines of circumvallation and contravallation,
their way of fortification, their foundries, instruments
of war, engines, and what else may occur observable;
and for his encouragement herein he was allowed the salary
of 1<em>l.</em> per diem, besides such advance as was considered
reasonable."</p>

<p class='c000'>A long and difficult lesson was this which Richard Burton
had to learn, and ere it should be mastered the Sovereign
who encouraged him should be gone from Whitehall.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the 15th of October, 1688, that undoubted advice
reached the King that "a great and sudden invasion, with
"an armed force of foreigners, was about to be made, in a
hostile manner, upon his kingdom;" and although it is
not contemplated to describe the campaigns of the pre-regimental
days, a description of the train of Artillery with
which he proposed to meet the invasion, and which was prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>for the purpose, cannot fail to be interesting. It is
the most largely officered train which we have as yet met;
and it was announced that, should the King accompany it
at any time himself, it should be further increased by the
presence of the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, the
Comptroller-General, the Principal Engineer, the Master-Gunner
of England and his Clerks, the Chief Firemaster
and his Mate, the Keepers and Makers of the Royal Tents
and their Assistants. Exclusive of these, whose presence
was conditional, the following was the <em>personnel</em> of</p>

<h3 class='c016'><em>James II.'s Artillery Train to Resist the Invasion of 1688</em>.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The reader will observe that in this train the Master-General
is not included, even in the contingency of the
King's accompanying it himself. Lord Dartmouth had
another duty to perform. He had been appointed Admiral
of the Fleet which was to engage, if possible, the immense
number of vessels which accompanied William to England.
The winds fought against Dartmouth. First, he was kept
at the mouth of the Thames by the same east winds that
wafted the enemy to their landing-place at Torbay; and
when, at last, able with a fair wind to follow down the
Channel in pursuit, just as he reached Portsmouth, the wind
changed: he had to run into that harbour, and his opportunity
was lost—an opportunity, too, which might have
reversed the whole story of the Revolution, for there was
more loyalty to the King in the navy than in the army,—a
loyalty which was whetted, as Macaulay well points out, by
old grudges between the English and Dutch seamen; and
there was in James's Admiral an ability and an integrity
which cannot be doubted. Had the engagement taken place,
and the King's fleet been successful, it does not require much
experience of the world's history to say that the Revolution
would have been postponed for years, if not for ever, for it is
marvellous how loyal waverers become to the side which has
the first success. Nor is this the first or only case on which
a kingdom, or something equally valuable, has hung upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>change of wind. How history would have to be re-written
had James Watt but lived two centuries earlier than he did!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant-General who was to command the train
was Sir Henry Shore, who had been appointed an Assistant
and Deputy at the Board to Sir Henry Tichborne. The
latter was, doubtless, the Lieutenant-General, whose presence
would also have been required had the King in person
accompanied the train.</p>

<p class='c025'>(Signed)    <span class='sc'>Dartmouth.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will observe that the position of the medical
officers of a train was still a very degraded one, relatively
speaking, in point of pay. The surgeon ranked with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>ladle-maker, the chief artificers, and the messenger; while
his assistant received the same remuneration for his services
as did the servants of the master wheelwright and master
cooper. The presence, in this train, of an Adjutant and a
Battery Master, is worthy of note, and also the intimation that
then, as now, on service, the Artillery had to take their share
in the transport of the small-arm ammunition of the Army.</p>

<p class='c000'>History moved rapidly now. After James's flight and a
brief interregnum, the Ordnance Office moves on again with
spirit under the new Master-General, the Duke de Schomberg.
Judging from the vigorous conduct displayed by him
during his brief career at the Board, one cannot but regret
that it was so soon cut short. One little anecdote reveals
the energy of the man's character, and enlists the sympathy
of that part of posterity—and the name is Legion!—which
has suffered from red tape and routine. There was naturally
a strong feeling in Scotland against the new King. Presbyterianism
itself could not dull the beating of the national
heart, which was moved by the memories of the old line of
Monarchs which had been given to England, whose gracious
ways almost condoned their offences, and whose offences were
easily forgotten in this their hour of tribulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men, guns, ammunition, and transport were all required
for Edinburgh and Berwick; but between the demand and
the supply stood that national buffer which seems to be
England's old man of the sea—a public department. For
transport the Master-General had to consult the Admiralty,
who, being consulted, began to coil the red tape round the
Master's neck, and nothing more. He entreats, implores,
and prays for even one ship to carry special engineers and
messages to the Forth; but the Admiralty quietly pigeon-holes
his prayers in a style worthy of two centuries later.
The Duke will have none of it: he writes to the Board to
give up this useless correspondence with a wooden-headed
Department; to take his own private yacht, and carry out
the King's service, without delay. Would that, to every
wearied postulant, there were a private yacht to waft him
out of the stagnant pool which officialism considers the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>perfection of Departmental Management, and in which he
might drift away from the very memory of pigeon-holes and
precedents!</p>

<p class='c000'>As might be expected, volumes of warrants, at this time,
reveal the changes made among the officials of the Ordnance.
The preparing of a warrant implied a fee; it is not
to be wondered at, therefore, that they were many. No office
under the Ordnance was too low to escape the necessity of a
warrant. There were chimney-sweeps to the Ordnance who
have been made immortal by this necessity, paviours, druggists,
messengers, and labourers. All must be made public
characters, because all must pay. Sex is no protection.
Candidates for Ordnance appointments who belong to the
fair sex cannot plead shyness and modesty in bar of their
warrants. So that Mary Pickering, who was reappointed
<em>cooper</em> at the Fort of Upnor, near Chatham, and Mary Braybrooke,
appointed <em>turner</em> at the same time, have come down
to posterity for the fee of ten shillings, when fairer and
nobler maidens have been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many Dutch, German, and even French names
among the new officials appointed for the Board's service.
But reappointments are, by no means, rare, if the old incumbents
would but change their allegiance. Among the changes
introduced by the Duke de Schomberg was one by which not
merely were there gentlemen of the Ordnance for the Tower
and the various trains, but also "for the out parts:" and if
there were no heavier duties for them to perform than those
specified in their warrants, they must have had a very easy
time of it, and earned their forty pounds a year without
much labour. According to their warrants, their duty was
to see that "all y<sup>e</sup> aprons, beds, and coynes belonging to
their Majesties' Traynes of Artillery at y<sup>e</sup> outposts do
remain upon the guns and carriages." If this were really
all they had to do, the old gunners of garrisons might have
done it quite as well for half the money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulty of getting arms for the troops which were
being raised for service in Ireland alarmed the Board greatly.
Very strong measures had to be taken: penalties were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>threatened on every one who kept arms concealed, or failed
to bring them to the Board; and a house-to-house search
was authorized. Gunsmiths were forbidden to sell to private
individuals, and commanded to devote all their energies to
manufacturing arms for the Board, and yet the need was
sore. Horses, also, had to be bought, and could with difficulty
be obtained; and such as were procured could not bear
the test of examination. So bad were they, that at last the
Master-General inspected in person not merely the horses
bought for the Artillery, but also the persons who bought
them. At his first inspection he found them all faulty—rejecting
some because they were too slight, some because
they were lame, and one because it was an old coach-horse.
With the difficulty of getting horses came also the difficulty
of procuring forage. The contract for the horses of the
Traynes for Chester and Ireland reached the unprecedented
sum of fifteen pence per horse for each day.</p>

<p class='c000'>To add to the other troubles of the new Board, the Chief
Firemaster and Engineer (Sir Martin Beckman), with all
the keenness and zeal of a renegade, kept worrying it
about the state of the various Forts and Barracks; whose
defects, he assured the Board, he had repeatedly urged on
the two preceding monarchs, but without avail, on account
of the deficiency of funds. "Berwick," he begged to assure
the Board, "is getting more defenceless every year, and will
take 31,000<em>l.</em> to be spent at once to prevent the place from
being safely insulted." For six years past he assured the
Board that Hull had been going to ruin: the earthworks
had been abused by the garrison, who had suffered all sorts
of animals to tread down the facings, and had, in the night-time,
driven in cattle, and made the people pay money before
they released them; and when they turned the cattle and
horses out, they drove them through the embrasures and
portholes, and so destroyed the facings, that, without speedy
repair and care, his Majesty would certainly be obliged to
make new ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bomb-vessels also occupied the attention of the Board.
More practical Artillerymen were required than could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>granted without greatly increasing the permanent establishment.
So a compromise was made; and a number of men
were hired and appointed <em>practitioner</em> bombardiers, at the
same rate of pay as others of the same rank, viz. 2<em>s.</em> per
diem, but with the condition that the moment their services
were no longer required they would be dispensed with.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were calls, also, from the West Indies on the sore-pressed
Board. A train of brass Ordnance was sent there,
to which were attached the following, among other officials:—A
Firemaster, at 10<em>s.</em> a day; a Master-Gunner, at 5<em>s.</em>;
Engineers, at various rates, but generally 10<em>s.</em>, who were
ordered to send home frequent reports and sketches; Bombardiers,
at 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; and a proportion of Gunners and
Matrosses, at 2<em>s.</em> and 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per diem respectively, whose
employment was guaranteed to them for six months at least.</p>

<p class='c000'>As if the Admiralty, the horsedealers, the West Indies,
Scotland, Ireland, and unseasonable zeal were not enough,
there must come upon the scene of the Board's deliberations
that irrepressible being, the "old soldier." The first Board
of William and Mary was generous in its dealings with its
officials almost to a fault. This is a failing which soon
reaches ears, however distant. Several miners absent in
Scotland, hoping that in the confusion the vouchers had
been mislaid, complained that they were in arrears of their
pay, "whereby," said the scoundrels, "they were discouraged
from performing their duties on this expedition." Enquiries
were made by the Board, and in the emphatic language of
their minute, it was found "that they <em>lied</em>, having been
fully paid up."</p>

<p class='c000'>When the time came for the Duke to shake off the immediate
worries of the office, as he proceeded to Chester and to
Ireland, his relief must have been great. With him he took
the chief waggon-master to assist in the organization of the
train in Ireland, leaving his deputy at the Tower to perform
his duties. The suite of the Master-General on his ride to
Chester included six sumpter mules with six sumpter men,
clad in large grey coats, the sleeves faced with <em>orange</em>, and
"the coats to be paid for out of their pay."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Only two more remarks remain to be made. The proportion
of drivers to the horses of William's train of Artillery
in Ireland may be gathered from an order still preserved
directing a fresh lot of horses and men to be raised in the
following proportions: one hundred and eighty horses;
thirty-six carters, and thirty-six boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, the dress of the train can be learned from the following
warrant, ordering:—</p>

<p class='c014'>"That the gunners, matrosses, and tradesmen have coates
of blew, with Brass Buttons, and lyned with orange bass,
and hats with orange silk Galoome. The carters, grey
coates lyned with the same. That order be given for the
making of these cloaths forthwith, and the money to be
deducted by equal proportions out of their paye by the
Treasurer of the Trayne."</p>

200; these being the numbers of suits of clothes respectively
ordered.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='sc'>Landmarks.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>In</span> the chaotic sea of warrants, correspondence, and orders
which represents the old MSS. of the Board of Ordnance
prior to the formation of the Royal Regiment of Artillery,
there are two documents which stand out like landmarks,
pointing to the gradual realization of the fact that a train
of Artillery formed when wanted for service, and disbanded
at the end of the campaign, was not the best way of making
use of this arm; and that the science of gunnery, and the
technical details attending the movement of Artillery in the
field, were not to be acquired intuitively, nor without careful
study and practice during time of peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first relates to the company of a hundred fee'd
gunners at the Tower of London, whose knowledge of artillery
has already been described as most inadequate, and
whose discipline was a sham. By a Royal Warrant dated
22nd August, 1682, this company was reduced to sixty in
number by weeding out the most incapable; the pay, which
had up to this time averaged sixpence a day to each man,
was increased to twelve-pence; but in return for this augmentation,
strict military discipline was to be enforced; in
addition to their ordinary duties at the Tower, they were to
be constantly exercised once a week in winter, and twice a
week in summer by the Master-Gunner of England; they
were to be dismissed if at any time found unfit for their
duties; and a blow was struck at the custom of men holding
these appointments, and also working at their trades near
the Tower, by its being distinctly laid down that they were
liable for duty not merely in that Fortress, but also "in
whatever other place or places our Master-General of the
Ordnance shall think fit."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>This was the first landmark, proclaiming that a nucleus
and a permanent one of a trained and disciplined Artillery
force was a necessity. Money was not plentiful at the
Ordnance Board under the Stuarts, as has already been
stated; so as time went on, and it was found necessary to
increase the educated element,—the fireworkers, petardiers,
and bombardiers,—it was done first by reducing the number
of gunners, and, at last, in 1686, by a grudgingly small
increase to the establishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1697, after the Peace of Ryswick, there was in the
English service a considerable number of comparatively
trained artillerymen, whose services during the war entitled
them to a little consideration. This fact, coupled with the
gradual growth in the minds of the military and Ordnance
authorities of the sense of the dangers that lay in the spasmodic
system, and the desirability of having some proportion
of artillerymen always ready and trained for service and
emergency, brought about the first—albeit short-lived—permanent
establishment, in a regimental form, of artillery in
England. The cost of the new regiment amounted to
4482<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> per annum, in addition to the pay which some of
them drew as being part of the old Ordnance permanent
establishment. But before a year had passed, the regiment
was broken up, and a very small provision made for the
officers. Some of the engineers, gentlemen of the Ordnance,
bombardiers, and gunners were added to the Tower establishment,
and seventeen years passed before this premature
birth was succeeded by that of the Royal Regiment of
Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this landmark is a remarkable one; and in a history
like the present deserves special notice. Some of the officers
afterwards joined the Royal Artillery; most of them fought
under Marlborough; and all had served in William's continental
campaign either by sea or land. Two of the captains
of companies, Jonas Watson and William Bousfield,
had served in the train in Flanders in 1694, and Albert
Borgard, its adjutant, was afterwards the first Colonel of
the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The staff of the little regiment consisted of a Colonel,
Jacob Richards, a Lieutenant-Colonel, George Browne, a
Major, John Sigismund Schmidt, an Adjutant, Albert Borgard,
and a Comptroller: of these the first four had been
serving on active service in Flanders. There were four
companies, very weak, certainly, and containing men paid
both on the old and new establishments. Each contained
1 captain, 1 first-lieutenant, 1 second-lieutenant, 2 gentlemen
of the Ordnance, 2 sergeants, and 30 gunners. Of these
the gentlemen of the Ordnance and 15 gunners per company
were on the old Tower establishment. The names of the
captains not mentioned above were Edward Gibbon, and
Edmund Williamson.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also in the Regiment six engineers, four sub-engineers,
two firemasters, twelve fireworkers, and twelve
bombardiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the regiment was reduced, the captains received
60<em>l.</em> per annum, the first and second lieutenants 50<em>l.</em> and
40<em>l.</em> per annum, the firemasters 60<em>l.</em>, and the fireworkers 40<em>l.</em>
These officers were described as belonging to the new establishment,
in contradistinction to the old.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time had now come when there was to be an establishment
of Artillery in addition to these, whose school and
arena were the campaigns of a great master of war, one who
was to be the means, after a victorious career, of placing the
stamp of permanence on what had as yet had but an ephemeral
existence,—the regimental character as applied to
Artillery forces in England.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='sc'>Marlborough's Trains.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Although</span> the description of campaigns which occurred
before the regimental birth of the Royal Artillery is
beyond the purpose and province of this history, yet so many
of the officers and men who fought under the great Duke of
Marlborough, or served in the various trains equipped by his
orders for Gibraltar, Minorca, and Nova Scotia, afterwards
were embodied in the regiment, that the reader must greet
with pleasure any notice of the constitution of these Trains,
as being in all probability typical of what the early companies
of the Regiment would be when attached to Ordnance
for service in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke of Marlborough was appointed Master-General
of the Ordnance almost immediately after the accession of
Queen Anne, and until the day of his death he evinced the
warmest and most intelligent interest in everything connected
with the Artillery Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will remember that one of the first acts of
Queen Anne was to declare war against France, with her
allies the Emperor of Germany and the States-General.
The declaration of war was not formally made until the
4th May, 1702, but preparations had been going on for a
couple of months before with a view to commencing hostilities.
On the 14th March, 1702, the warrant for the Train
of Artillery required for the opening campaign was issued to
the Earl of Romney, then Master-General. The number of
pieces of Ordnance required was fixed at 34, including 14
sakers, 16 3-pounders, and 4 howitzers: and the <em>personnel</em>
considered adequate to the management of these guns consisted
of two companies of gunners, one of pioneers, and one
of pontoon men, in addition to the requisite staff, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>number of artificers. Each company consisted of a captain,
a lieutenant, a gentleman of the Ordnance, six non-commissioned
officers, twenty-five gunners, and an equal number of
matrosses. At this time the fireworkers and bombardiers
were not on the strength of the companies as was afterwards
the case. Two fireworkers and eight bombardiers accompanied
this train.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pioneers were twenty in number, with two sergeants,
and there was the same number of pontoon men, with two
corporals, the whole being under a Bridge-master. The staff
of the train consisted of a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a
major, a comptroller, a paymaster with his assistant, an adjutant,
a quartermaster, a chaplain, a commissary of horse, a
surgeon and assistant-surgeon, and a provost-marshal. The
kettledrummer and his coachman accompanied the train.
There were also present with this train a commissary of
stores with an assistant, two clerks, twelve conductors, eight
carpenters, four wheelwrights, three smiths, and two tinmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rates of pay of the various attendants are again worthy
of note. The master carpenter, smith, and wheelwright got
a shilling daily more than the assistant-surgeon, who had to
be happy on 3<em>s.</em> per diem; the provost-marshal and the
tinman each got 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; the clerks and the gentlemen of
the Ordnance were equally paid 4<em>s.</em>; the chaplain, adjutant,
and quartermaster received 6<em>s.</em> each; a lieutenant received
the same, and a fireworker 2<em>s.</em> less. The pay of the higher
ranks was as follows:—Colonel, 1<em>l.</em> 5<em>s.</em>; lieutenant-colonel
and comptroller, each 1<em>l.</em>; major, 15<em>s.</em>; and paymaster, 10<em>s.</em>
The gunners received 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; matrosses, pioneers, and pontoon-men,
each, 1<em>s.</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the month of June, 1702, before this train landed
in Holland, and on the 30th of that month it joined the
Allied Army at Grevenbrouck, having had an addition made
to it of four guns before leaving England. The pay of the
train amounted to 9289<em>l.</em> 5<em>s.</em> per annum; and the ammunition
with which they commenced the campaign consisted of
3600 rounds, of which 3000 were round shot, and 600
canister or case. They also carried 31 boxes of small hand-grenades,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and 754 grenades of a larger description. The
conduct in the field of this train was admirable. During
the whole campaign of 1702, their fire is described as having
been carried on with "as much order, despatch, and success
as ever before was seen."</p>

<p class='c000'>And then, in the luxurious way in which war was made in
those days, the army went into winter quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the campaign of 1703, it was decided to augment the
train of Artillery, and a warrant to that effect was issued to
the Ordnance on the 8th February, 1703. The only difference
in the <em>personnel</em> of the train was the addition of five gunners
to each company, they now outnumbering the matrosses for
the first time. The addition to the guns consisted of six
demi-culverins.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March of this year, the Board of Ordnance was also
called upon to fit out two bomb-vessels for service in the
Channel; and as the bomb-service remained long after
the Regiment existed, it may be interesting to the reader
to learn the armament of these vessels. It consisted of three
13-inch brass sea-service mortars, one vessel carrying two.
For ammunition they carried 1200 shells and 40 carcasses,—besides
248 barrels of powder. The Artillerymen on board
were represented by three fireworkers, six bombardiers, and
two artificers; but as provision was made for ten, not eleven,
"small flock bedds, bolsters, ruggs, and blankets," it is to
be presumed either that one of the number was above the
necessity of sleep, or that a certain socialism existed in
the matter of beds, which admitted of the individual on duty
adjourning to the bed vacated by the man who relieved
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a later warrant of the same year, when a larger number
of these vessels was ordered to the Mediterranean, a Firemaster
at 8<em>s.</em> per diem was placed over the fireworkers, and
a few conductors of stores were added.</p>

<p class='c000'>A further addition was made in 1704 to the train in Holland,
showing the increased appreciation of the services of
the Artillery. It consisted of six brass culverins and four
3-pounders, with two gentlemen of the Ordnance, sixteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>gunners, and sixty of their assistants, the matrosses. Two
more artificers were also added.</p>

<p class='c000'>An idea of the Artillery train under Marlborough's own
command can be obtained from the above dry details, and
when compared with the proportions of Artillery in the
armies of more recent times, Marlborough's train excites a
smile. The value of Artillery in the field had not yet been
learned, while the cumbrous nature of its equipment was
painfully present to every General. Not until Napoleon
came on the scene did Artillery assume its proper place in
European armies; not until the Franco-German War of
1870 did it assume its proper place in European opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>But equally interesting with the details of the train which
Marlborough commanded are those of the trains, which, as
Master-General of the Ordnance, he prepared for expeditions
and services under other commanders, in the stormy time
which was hushed to rest by the Peace of Utrecht.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the expedition to Portugal, ordered in 1703, but
which did not take place till the following year, was decided
on, the armament selected consisted merely of five brass sakers,
and one 5¼-pounder.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this small battery, a somewhat eccentric detail of
attendants was ordered, characterized by the marked absence
of Artillery <em>officers</em>. They were as follows:—One commander,
styled commander-in-chief, with a daily pay of 1<em>l.</em>;
six engineers, with 10<em>s.</em> each; a commissary of stores, five
bombardiers, twenty gunners, and ten miners. The absence
of matrosses in this detail is also remarkable. The deficiencies
in this train soon became apparent, for in 1705 we find
it was reinforced by a captain, a lieutenant, a fireworker, a
surgeon, and forty-two matrosses, with a proportion of non-commissioned
officers. And with the reinforcement came
six mountain 3-pounders—guns, which from this time and
for many years were familiarly known as grasshoppers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the other musty warrants of this time, calling upon
"our entirely-beloved Master-General of the Ordnance, John
Duke of Marlborough," to furnish various trains and necessaries,
one short one on the 3rd October, 1704, has a peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>interest. Intelligence had just been received of the capture
of Gibraltar by Sir George Rooke, and it became necessary
to send, for the better protection of the Rock, a few guns, and
some men familiar with their use. In this year, 1872, seven
Batteries of Artillery, each numbering 160 men when complete,
are considered necessary, the lesson not having yet
been forgotten, which was taught by the great siege, when
five weak companies were all the Artillery in the garrison,
and gunners had to be improvised out of the ranks of the
Infantry. But the force during the great siege was lavish
compared with that deemed sufficient at first "for the better
defence of y<sup>e</sup> said place." One chief engineer, Talbot
Edwards by name, a storekeeper and his clerk, two fireworkers,
six bombardiers, and fifty-five gunners, were at
first deemed sufficient Artillery force for the defence of a
place whose chief means of protection lay in its guns. Half-a-dozen
brass 13-inch mortars, and four-and-twenty guns
on ship carriages, varying from 6-pounders to 24-pounders,
constituted the armament sent from England.</p>

<p class='c000'>In April of the following year the Master-General was
called upon to furnish a train for that romantic expedition
to Spain under the brilliant Earl of Peterborough, the services
of which afterwards at the capture of Barcelona called
forth such commendation. It was a very small one. In a
corps of 5000 men the following was the proportion of
Artillery:—One colonel, one adjutant, two engineers, a
commissary, a paymaster, four conductors, one master-gunner,
four sergeants, four corporals, ten gunners, one
firemaster, one fireworker, two bombardiers, two carpenters,
three wheelwrights, two smiths, and a collar-maker. Mortars
on travelling carriages were used by this train, and a
considerable number of sets of men-harness which accompanied
it suggests the idea that the services of the other
troops, or the peasantry, were enlisted, when necessary, to
move the train from place to place.</p>

<p class='c000'>In May, 1706, 11,000 men under the command of Earl
Rivers were ordered to sail from Plymouth on a wild and
futile scheme for the invasion of France. The following was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the proportion of Artillery considered necessary for this
force by the Board over which Marlborough presided. The
guns were forty-six in number, including twenty 24-pounders,
six culverins, four 12-pounders, four demi-culverins, and six
sakers. There were also sixty small coehorn mortars.</p>

<p class='c000'>To man the train, the following was the detail: a colonel,
four engineers, two sub-engineers, a paymaster, a surgeon,
with an assistant, a captain, a lieutenant, two gentlemen of
the Ordnance, three sergeants, three corporals, thirty-two
gunners, and sixty-four matrosses, a lieutenant of miners,
and seventeen men, a firemaster, three fireworkers, and
twelve bombardiers, a commissary, clerk of the stores, twelve
conductors, three smiths, three wheelwrights, five carpenters,
two coopers, a collar-maker, two farriers, and fifteen carters.
In this train the lieutenant of miners and the chief carpenter,
received each 4<em>s.</em> a day, while the assistant-surgeon with his
3<em>s.</em> remains ranked with the farriers, cooper's mate, and
collar-maker.</p>

<p class='c000'>The list of stores is too long for reproduction here. But
it included 200 sets of single harness for men, and four
sets of harness for fifty men to each set. Tumbrils and
waggons innumerable were ordered; 400 wheelbarrows,
2000 palisadoes, 1600 horseshoes, tents, single and double
beds, and an assortment of artificers' tools such as would
enrich a colony. Altogether it was an appalling catalogue.
The ammunition for the train included 22,000 round shot,
2400 mortar-bombs, 800 case-shot, and 3000 barrels of
powder. For the Infantry 46 tons of musket-shot were
carried, and 100,000 flints.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1707, it was resolved to reduce the trains formerly
under the directions of Lords Galway, Peterborough, and
Rivers, into one field train for service in Spain, and as the
Board of Ordnance reported that they had no money for
the subsistence of the train, the commissioners of the
Treasury were ordered to pay the cost out of the 500,000<em>l.</em>
voted by Parliament with a view to "strengthening the
Army of the Duke of Savoy for making good our alliances
with the King of Portugal, and for the more effectual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>carrying on the war of the recovery of the Spanish
monarchy to the house of Austria." <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur</span></i>:
what ministerial eloquence would be able to charm money
out of a House of Commons now for such a purpose? The
following was the detail of the combined train:—one colonel,
and one lieutenant-colonel, receiving the same pay, 1<em>l.</em> 5<em>s.</em> per
diem; one major, at 15<em>s.</em>; one comptroller, at 1<em>l.</em>; one paymaster,
at 8<em>s.</em> and an assistant at 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; an adjutant,
quartermaster, commissary of horse, and waggon-master,
each at 6<em>s.</em>; a surgeon, at 5<em>s.</em>, and two assistants, at 3<em>s.</em>;
two captains, two lieutenants, two gentlemen of the Ordnance,
six sergeants, six corporals, forty gunners, eighty
matrosses, four drummers, ten engineers, a fireworker,
two bombardiers, twelve conductors, and twenty-one artificers.
There was also a provost-marshal with two assistants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only one more train requires to be mentioned. After the
legislative union between Scotland and England, it was
decided by the Board of Ordnance to establish a small permanent
train, called the train for North Britain, at Edinburgh,
Stirling, and Fort William. As mentioned in the
first chapter of this book, the last-named place did not derive
the benefit that was contemplated at the formation of this
train. From the nature of the Ordnance sent to Scotland,
the absence of conductors and matrosses, and the presence of
storekeepers and gunsmiths, it is evident that a field train,
in the sense of one for service in the field, was not contemplated.
The defence of the fortresses at the three places
named was all that was intended, combined with the supervision
of the Ordnance Stores which might be deposited in
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The capture of Minorca during the war involved a small
train for Port Mahon in that Island; and another was
required for Annapolis in 1710.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Peace of Utrecht, the Ordnance Board found
that in addition to its small peace establishment in England
there were four trains to keep up permanently, whether in
peace or war, which were not required before. These were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the trains of North Britain, Gibraltar, Port Mahon, and a
joint train for service in Placentia and Annapolis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'être</span></i> of the trains at the first three of these
places has already been given. To explain the circumstances
under which the other places became a charge on the Ordnance
will require another chapter.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='sc'>Annapolis.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>On</span> the Nova Scotian side of the Bay of Fundy, immediately
opposite the City of St. John, New Brunswick,
there is a narrow inlet of the sea, walled by perpendicular
and densely wooded hills. A few scattered cottages, belonging
to fishermen, speck the deep green of the forest, as
the traveller passes up this narrow channel, known by the
uneuphonious name of Digby Gut. Digby is a small picturesque
village, immediately inside the channel, which here
opens out into a wide basin, large enough to float mighty
navies, and beyond description beautiful. In the spring of
1604, a French Protestant, M. de Monts, first discovered
this harbour of safety, and one of his comrades, Potrincourt
by name, was so enchanted by its beauties, that he applied
to the French monarch for a grant of the surrounding district.
At the end of the basin, furthest from the entrance
and at the mouth of a river, now called the Cornwallis river,
he built a Fort and a village, to which he gave the name of
Port Royal. The history of this little village has been one
of marvellous interest; and until the beginning of the
eighteenth century, it was written in letters of blood. Since
it finally became the property of England, its existence has
been a peaceful one; and now, alas, the mouldering ramparts,
the tumbling, grass-grown walls of the old fort, and the
windowless, stairless barrack, proclaim in unmistakable
language the advent of a new colonial epoch, and the retreat
of British troops before that new enemy—expense. The
train required for its defence, after its final capture, was one
of the arguments used in favour of creating a permanent
force of Artillery in England; and for more than a century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>this village of Port Royal, or Annapolis, has been entwined
in the history of the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>If all historical researches were pursued in such beautiful
localities, the historian would be the veriest sybarite of
literature. By the tumbling fortifications now stands one
of the loveliest villages on the face of this world. The river,
at whose mouth it is built, wanders through a valley, which,
in summer, is like a dream of beauty. Rich <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intervalle</span></i> land
on either bank, covered with heavy crops of every kind; fields
and gardens studded with apple-trees, planted by the old
French inhabitants; grapes in heavy clusters growing and
ripening in the open air, and clean, white churches and
cottages studding the landscape for miles; all unite in
forming a picture, like the Utopia which haunts the
dreamer's mind. The garden of Canada—an Artilleryman
may well rejoice that so lovely a spot had a share in the
birth of the corps to which he belongs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early history of the place may be summed up in a few
words. In 1606, an addition to the little colony was made
of more French emigrants; cultivation of the soil, and the
breeding of cattle occupied the peaceful inhabitants; and
they lived in perfect amity with the surrounding Indians.
Difficulties having arisen about the original charter, Potrincourt
went to France, and secured from the King the grant
of the territory: subject, however, to a distasteful condition,
that he should take two Jesuit priests with him on his
return. He did so; but made them as uncomfortable as he
could, and in 1613, they left him to join a settlement, also
near the Bay of Fundy, vowing vengeance against him in
their hearts. Although England and France were at peace,
a sea rover from Virginia, named Argoll, came with his ship,
and pillaged the Jesuits' new home, killing one, and making
the other prisoner. Fired by his success, and urged and
guided by the revengeful priest, he next fitted out an expedition
against Port Royal, and succeeded in destroying the
fort, and scattering the settlers, some of whom joined the
neighbouring Indian tribes. During the next few years,
more French immigrants settled in a scattered, unmethodical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>way, over the province of Nova Scotia, or Acadia, as it was
called; and some coming to Port Royal, the little colony
commenced to revive.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in 1627, Kirke's fleet sailed from England to destroy
the French settlements in Nova Scotia; and among others,
he ravaged unhappy Port Royal. And from this time dates
the struggle in America between France and England, which
lasted a hundred years. In 1629, it may be said, that we had
added Nova Scotia to our possessions; but in 1632, we gave
it back to France; Charles I. having been in treaty with the
French King, even while our expedition in America was at
work, and having consented to let the French have Quebec
and all our recent American conquests back again. In 1655,
Cromwell recovered Port Royal, by means of an expedition
he sent for that purpose, under one Major Sedgwick. The
fort had by this time been strengthened and armed; but it
had to surrender to the impetuosity of our troops. Much
labour and money was now spent on the fortifications by the
English, but all to no purpose, for by the treaty of Breda,
Charles II. ceded Nova Scotia to the French again. Certainly,
the Stuarts were cruel to our colonies; and it
required all the enterprise of our merchants, and all the
courage and skill of our seamen and fishermen to resist utter
extinction under the treatment they received. The day was
to come—and to last for many a year, when a worse evil
than the Stuarts was to blight our colonies—the nightmare
of the Colonial Office. As the former was the positive, so it
was the comparative degree of colonial endurance. Is it
true that a superlative degree is coming on them now? Is
it true, that in our Statesmen's minds there exists a coldness,
an indifference to our colonies, which in time of trial or
danger will certainly pass into impatience, and anxiety to be
free from colonial appendages?</p>

<p class='c000'>If it be so, then, indeed, the superlative degree of blundering
and misery is approaching; but the misery, like the
blundering, will be found this time, not in the colonies, but
in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>For sixteen years after the treaty of Breda, Port Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>was left comparatively undisturbed; the French population
reaching, in the year 1671, 361 souls; 364 acres having
been brought under cultivation, and nearly 1000 sheep and
cattle being owned by the settlers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1680, however, the English again, for the fifth time,
obtained possession of it; and again lost it. After its recapture,
and before 1686, considerable additions had been
made to the fortifications by the French; and in the treaty
of that year between France and England, it was resolved—a
resolution which was never kept—that although the
mother countries might quarrel, their respective American
subjects might continue to maintain mutual peaceable relations.
After the Revolution of 1688, war broke out in
Europe once more between France and England, and their
American children followed suit. Port Royal being the head-quarters
for the French ships attracted the attention of Sir
William Phipps, who after capturing and pillaging it abandoned
it again to the French.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the treaty of Ryswick again officially announced that
the whole of Nova Scotia was French territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1699, and again in 1701, considerable labour was devoted
by the French to strengthening the works of Port
Royal; an increase to the garrison was made from France,
and the militia in the surrounding settlements were carefully
trained and armed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every difficulty was interposed by the French governors
between the settlers and the New England merchants, who
were mutually eager for trade. Exasperated by prohibitory
duties on their wares, the latter first tried smuggling, and
then hostile expeditions. One such was made from Boston
in 1704; and although Port Royal made a successful resistance,
much damage was done to the surrounding country.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1707, two expeditions were made from New England,
and a large force of militia accompanied them. They were
convoyed by a man-of-war, and would undoubtedly have
captured the place, had it not been for the personal energy
of Subercase, the French governor, who rallied the neighbouring
inhabitants, and drove back the English, thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>dispirited. On the second occasion, the English attempted
to float their artillery up the river with the tide by night,
and attack the fort from the land side. The rise and fall of
the tide in the Bay of Fundy and its inlets are very great,
often reaching sixty feet. The French governor, seeing the
enemy's design, lit large fires along the banks of the river,
and exposed the drifting boats with the English guns on
board to the view of the artillerymen in the fort, who opened
a fire which utterly prevented the English from advancing
further, or effecting a landing. By the 1st of September,
the New Englanders were utterly foiled and dispirited, the
object of the expedition was frustrated, and the fleet weighed
anchor and returned to Boston. After these two attempts,
rendered unsuccessful by the marvellous tact and energy of
one man, Port Royal enjoyed comparative rest, and the
leisure of the inhabitants was devoted to strengthening the
works during the next two years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before describing the circumstances of its final capture,
let some explanation be given of the incessant war which
went on for so many years between the French and English
colonists in North America. It was not a burning interest
in the European questions agitating the parent countries
that animated their Western children; the parent quarrels
were an excuse, but not a reason, for their mutual aggression;
and the absence of such excuse did not ensure peace in
America. The cause lay in the two feelings which prompt
most wars: thirst for revenge and love of trade. The way
in which the last acted has already been hinted at. There
was undoubtedly a market among the French colonists,
which was all the New England merchants could desire; and
so ready were the French peasants to trade, that no prohibitory
action of their rulers could conceal their desire,
although in a great measure it might prevent its gratification.
The knowledge of this made the New Englanders frantic.
They were men of immense energy, as they are now; they
were of magnificent physique, made for war and hardship;
and they rebelled against any obstacle to what they deemed
their legitimate wishes. Their anger became intolerance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>their intolerance became aggressive; and the result was first
smuggling, then privateering, and finally war.</p>

<p class='c000'>But another motive was thirst for revenge. And why?
Was there not room on this vast continent for both nations
to plant any wandering or surplus children, without the
vile passions seeking place, which thrive in the hot-bed of
crowded, neighbouring, and rival states? Here the old poet's
words come in most truly: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cœlum, non animum, mutant,
qui trans mare currunt.</span>"</p>

<p class='c000'>National jealousies <em>were</em> reproduced: the French allied
themselves in Canada with the Indians, and incessant incursions
were made thence by them on the English colonies.
Hardly a child grew up in New England who did not know
of some hideous tragedy in the domestic life of his immediate
neighbours, if not in his own family; from infancy one of
the articles of his creed was detestation of the French; and
this feeling found ready and revengeful expression whenever
opportunity offered. But revenge is not always true in
its aim, is indeed often wofully blind; and too often when
maddened with thoughts of cruelty and outrage on his wife
or sisters—and what thoughts stir the Anglo-Saxon more
fiercely?—he would avenge himself wildly and recklessly on
victims who mayhap were innocent. And so the ghastly vendetta
crossed from hand to hand, from one side to the
other, and hardly a year passed without its existence being
attested by tales of horror and of blood!</p>

<p class='c000'>But the end for Port Royal was approaching, an end which
was to mean defeat, but was to ensure a lasting peace. In
1709, news reached the Governor of an intended attack on a
large scale in the ensuing spring by the English; and as
his garrison had recently been much reduced by disease, he
wrote, strongly urging its reinforcement either from France,
or from the French post at Placentia, in Newfoundland.
Apparently, his request was not complied with; and after a
gallant, and almost heroic resistance, Port Royal capitulated
in the following year to the expeditionary forces under the
command of Colonel Nicholson, comprising regular troops
from England, militia from New York, and a strong train of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Artillery,—the whole being supported by a powerful fleet.
On the 2nd October, 1710, the capitulation was signed; and,
out of compliment to the Queen, the name of the village was
changed to Annapolis.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fortnight after the expedition left England for New
York and Boston, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> to Port Royal, a Royal Warrant
was issued establishing a Train of Artillery to <em>garrison
Annapolis</em>. It will thus be seen that so confident was the
English Government of the success of the expedition, that
the new name for Port Royal had already been fixed, and
arrangements made for a permanent garrison. The acquisition
of Newfoundland followed; the French garrison of
Placentia were allowed with many of the inhabitants to go to
the Island of Cape Breton, where they fortified a place which
will occupy a prominent part in this volume, Louisbourg;
and the year 1713 saw, by the Treaty of Utrecht, Acadia or
Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland formally surrendered to the
English.</p>

<p class='c000'>The train of Artillery formed to garrison Annapolis, and
its adjunct ordered three years later for Placentia, were two
of the permanent trains used as arguments in 1716 for
establishing a fixed Artillery Regiment which could feed
these foreign garrisons—arguments which in that year
brought into existence the Royal Regiment of Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Artillery garrison ordered for Annapolis in 1710,
comprised a captain, a lieutenant, a surgeon, 4 non-commissioned
officers, 11 gunners, 40 matrosses, an engineer, a
storekeeper, 3 bombardiers, and 2 armourers.</p>

<p class='c000'>That for Placentia was smaller and differently constituted.
It consisted of an engineer, a master-gunner, 20 gunners,
a mason, a smith, a carpenter, and an armourer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of the Annapolis train was 1964<em>l.</em> 18<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> per
annum: that of the Placentia train was 1259<em>l.</em> 5<em>s.</em> After
the Regiment was created, these two trains or garrisons
were generally furnished by the same company, and mutually
met each other's deficiencies or demands. For many years,
these places appeared in the Ordnance estimates, not merely
as items in the expense of maintaining the Artillery and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Engineers, but also as requiring considerable sums for fortifications.
Occasionally the number of men was reduced, as
in 1725, when at Placentia there were only 1 lieutenant and
8 gunners; and at Annapolis, 1 lieutenant, 2 bombardiers,
4 gunners, and 7 matrosses. But the amount spent on the
fortifications remained for years very considerable. Up to
the year 1759, the average spent on this item annually at
the two places was 3000<em>l.</em> and 1000<em>l.</em>; but in 1747 and 1748,
evidently exceptional years, the expenditure rose to 10,000<em>l.</em>
and 6000<em>l.</em> respectively. In 1759, a large sum appears to
have been spent in transporting to Nova Scotia the guns
and stores taken from the French at Louisbourg. After
1759, Annapolis gradually dwindles down as a military
station, being dwarfed by Halifax, whose Artillery expenses
in that year alone amounted to nearly 40,000<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>For a century longer, Annapolis retained the special distinction
of giving the title of Governor, with a considerable
income, to the officer commanding the troops in the maritime
provinces of British North America. But its martial glory
has now altogether faded; gradually diminishing in numbers,
its garrison at length consisted of the solitary barrack sergeant,
who is the "last man" of every military epic; and
now even he has departed. The old Fort is a ruin, the
barracks crumbling and unsightly; but, in spite of the pain
one feels at first witnessing this modern indifference to
ancient story,—this forgetfulness of the memories which in
stately procession troop through the student's mind,—this
feeling is soon obliterated as one turns to gaze on happy
homesteads and blooming gardens, and on contented faces
which meet one at every turn as one wanders over the
fertile country, away even to that "Bloody Creek," where, in
one of their many engagements, some thirty Englishmen met
a cruel death, by an unexpected attack made by some Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where are the Indians now? A few drunken, demoralized
creatures hang about some of the towns; two or three only
have retained their love and instinct for the chase; and
before many years shall have passed away, Acadia shall know
the Mic-mac no more!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Birth of the Regiment.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> hour had come,—and the man! The Duke of Marlborough
was again at the head of the Ordnance, and
was both capable himself of detecting the faults of the
existing system, and of critically comprehending any suggestions
for its improvement which the Board might lay before
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never had the old system so completely broken down as
during the rebellion in Scotland in 1715. The best practical
Artilleryman in the pay of the Ordnance had been sent in
command of the train—Albert Borgard; but two years' rust
since the peace of Utrecht had so tarnished any brightness
which Artillery details in England had gained in the friction
of the preceding campaigns, that Borgard's task was a hopeless
one. Suspicions have been cast upon the loyalty of the
Duke of Argyle, who commanded the King's forces in Scotland,
and certainly, at first sight, his contradictory orders to
the Artillery excite astonishment. But it is more probable
that the key to his management of this arm lay in the
impossible task of creating order out of what Borgard himself
described as "such confusion as cannot be expressed."
In the month of December, the train was ordered to Scotland;
it was February before they anchored in the Firth of
Forth. The first orders received by Borgard from Argyle,
were to send his ships and guns away to Innerkithen, and
march his officers and "artillery people" to Stirling. On
arriving there, he was ordered to take command of a very
confused train of field-pieces, which had been ordered up
from the Castle of Edinburgh. Part of this train he succeeded
in getting as far as Dundee, where orders were sent
him to take the whole back again to Edinburgh <em>by water</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>In the following March, his enforced idleness was brought
to an end by orders he received to send back his vessels with
the guns, which had never been unshipped, to London. He
and his men were then to be available for other service.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a gross case of inability to furnish, within any
reasonable time, Artillery for service in the field, followed
by such uselessness and confusion, could not be overlooked,
nor allowed to pass without an effort at improvement for the
future. Public admission of defects in a Department cannot
be expected; and when consciousness of their existence is
present in the minds of the officials, their manner is to suggest
a remedy, but to evolve the evil, which the remedy is to
cure, either from other sources, or from their own imaginations.
The student, who turns from the ghastly tale of
incompetence and blundering in 1715, to see what steps the
Ordnance Board took to prevent its recurrence, need not,
therefore, be surprised to find a very slight allusion to their
own blunders, and a gushing catalogue of the benefits which
will result from the adoption of their new suggestions. In
fact, in their letter of 10th January, 1716, to the Master-General,
the members of the Board use language of virtuous
and indignant protest; and instead of alluding to the recent
failures, they talk of the hardships which the existing system
had wrought upon their office. It is, perhaps, ungracious to
criticise too closely the language used when suggesting a
really important and valuable innovation; but when we find
the foreign establishments of Annapolis and Placentia, of
Gibraltar and Port Mahon, quoted as the arguments in chief
for a change, which would probably never have been suggested
but for the conspicuous failure of the preceding year,
the temptation is irresistible to draw the mask from the face
of complacent officialism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Summing the case up in a few words, it may be said that
the annual cost of that part of the military branch of the
office of the Ordnance which the Board proposed gradually
to abolish at this time, including the foreign establishments
at the places above mentioned, amounted to 16,829<em>l.</em>
The Regimental establishment, which it was now proposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to substitute by degrees, consisting of four companies with
an adequate staff, would, on the Board's calculation, cost
only 15,539<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>The main reduction was to be obtained by allowing the
North Britain establishment, which cost annually 1200<em>l.</em>,
gradually to become extinct, the duties to be performed by
the new companies. The foreign establishments were also
to be supplied in the same way. Of course, it was not pretended
that all this could be done at once. But as vacancies
occurred in the existing establishment, the money would go
to furnish men for the cadres of the new companies, which
it was proposed at once to create. And by removing the
Artillery officers and the 120 gunners now on the old establishment
to the rolls of the new companies, the skeletons
would have a little flesh and blood from the commencement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The details of the other economies suggested by the Board,
and the list of officials whose places it was not proposed to
fill when vacant, naturally excite the curiosity of the student.
Surely, this time at least, a little self-denial will be practised
by the Honourable Board; some superfluous clerks and
secretaries will be lopped off; and after their protest against
those members of the military branch who never go on duty
without having heavy travelling charges and extra pay,
surely we shall find some economy practised by the Honourable
Board, whose members revel in these very items. Alas!
no. Tradition is too strong; and self-preservation is their
first instinct. There are storekeepers in Edinburgh and
Fort William, whom distance will prevent from personal
remonstrance; a percentage of their wretched income can
safely be taken. And as for those whose offices are ultimately
to be extinguished, they themselves can have no
personal grievance, and posterity can look after itself. So,
engineers, and firemasters, and petardiers, are marked for
destruction; and the Board's sacrilegious hand is raised
against the Master-Gunner of England himself!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on the 26th day of May, 1716, that the Regimental
Baby was born. It was smaller than had been expected;
but it has proved a healthy and long-lived child, and, as its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>nurse might have said, it has grown out of all knowledge.
Only two companies—without any staff—were given at first,
at an annual cost of 4891<em>l.</em> But, in Colonel Miller's clear
language, "considering that these two companies were never
reduced, and that the remaining two, as well as the field-officers,
were added within a few years, there can be no
hesitation about taking this as the starting-point for any
<em>Regimental Records</em> of the Royal Artillery."</p>

<p class='c000'>In December, 1716, the Board was able to inform the
Master-General of the success of the scheme: the two companies
were nearly complete; but the dream of feeding the
foreign establishments could not be realized, from the fact
that only half its proposal had, as yet, been carried into
effect. So it was obliged to request, that arrangements
for these should be made for the present, elsewhere than
from the two companies at home. Ere many years had
passed, the whole of the scheme recommended by the Duke
of Marlborough was at work; in 1722, a Colonel was given
to the Regiment; and in 1727, we find a Lieutenant-Colonel
and a Major, as well as four complete companies; but in the
years of comparative quiet which followed, no further augmentation
took place. It was not until the year 1740, that
we find two more companies were added to the Regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The name of the Lieutenant-Colonel in 1727, one we have
already met with, and who had seen much service, was
Jonas Watson. That of the Major was James Petit. He
also had seen considerable service; but neither of them in
that respect could approach the brave and experienced officer
to whom the command of the Regiment was given by George
I., in 1722, and emphatically renewed by George II., in 1727,
the celebrated Albert Borgard.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='sc'>Albert Borgard.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Not</span> a statesman, not over-refined, and no scholar, a
mere soldier of fortune—yet brave, and honest, and
true—Albert Borgard deserves more than a passing notice
in a history of the Regiment which he was the first to
command.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was by birth a Dane. Born in 1659, he commenced
his life as a soldier when sixteen years of age, and until the
day of his death, on the 7th February, 1751, at the age of
ninety-two years, he never had a thought beyond his profession
and his duty. The diary appended to this chapter
gives in his own words the best summary of his career
which can be written. For <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> and modesty, it can
hardly be surpassed. The compression into two or three
lines, of events on which most men would enlarge with
effusion; and the simple narrative of wounds and hardships,
as if such were the ordinary circumstances of war, and unworthy
of special comment, cannot fail to strike the most
superficial reader. The only sentence that gives us pain is
the plaintive allusion to one who supplanted him with the
Board of Ordnance, as Consulting Artilleryman and Engineer.
He was so devoted to his profession, that anything
which looked like putting him on one side hurt him beyond
expression. There is a time in the lives of many active men,
when they realize painfully that others are growing up who
can outstrip them in work, or who have modern ideas and
appliances which it is now too late for them to learn. The
pain of such a discovery is, perhaps, the most acute that a
man can feel.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that date, Borgard devoted himself to his men.
Living in the Warren at Woolwich, constantly among them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>he was incessant in urging them to master the details of
their profession. Being devoted himself to all laboratory
work, his order-books are full of instructions to the cadets
and young officers, to devote their leisure to practical lessons
in that department. And he encouraged any who might
succeed in making any good "Firework" to bring it to him
for inspection and approval. He was a strict disciplinarian;
and some of the punishments he awarded would astonish
modern soldiers. But he was essentially honest, incapable of
falsehood or meanness, and if every man in this worthy world
were, like him, brave and honest and true, what a Paradise
it would be!</p>

<p class='c000'>He commenced his military career in the service of the
King of Denmark. He went from that, in 1689, to the King
of Prussia's service; served in Hungary in 1691; and was
induced by William III. to join the English service in the
following year. At the termination of hostilities he and one
other foreigner, named Schlunt, whose name appears in the
list of officers of the short-lived regiment of 1698, were the
only Artillerymen other than English, who were selected to
proceed to England for permanent employment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1702, he went as Major in the expedition to Cadiz,
and carried on a successful bombardment with the five
bomb-vessels under his command. In the following year he
volunteered for service under Marlborough, but, after a few
months in Flanders, he was recalled to proceed to Spain with
the expedition under Sir George Rooke and the Duke de
Schomberg, which escorted the Archduke Charles, who had
just been proclaimed by his father, King of Spain. Until
the year 1710, he was engaged in all the hostilities which
were now carried on in Spain, and of which his diary gives
a summary. In 1705, at the siege of Valencia, which was
taken by the English under Lord Galway, (who had been appointed
to the command in place of Schomberg), he lost his
left arm; and in 1710, he was wounded in the leg by a round
shot, and taken prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his first service with the Royal Artillery, after its
existence as a regiment, was in 1719, when he went in command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of the Artillery of Lord Cobham's force against Spain,
and successfully bombarded Vigo. The troops, 4000 in
number, embarked in a squadron of five men-of-war under
Admiral Mighells, and coasting from Corunna to Vigo, were
landed two or three miles from the town. The garrison of
Vigo withdrew to the citadel, spiking the guns in the town;
but so heavy and well-directed was the fire of the English,
that they soon capitulated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the Artillery arrangements, both in preparing
and handling the train, had been under Colonel Borgard's
sole control. Judging from the entry in his diary, he was
far more pleased by the success of his inventions and improvements
in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span></i> of his train, than by the surrender
of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this was the first train of Artillery to which the Royal
Artillery Companies were attached on active service, it has
been considered desirable to give some details as to its constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, as to <em>personnel</em>:—It was commanded by Colonel
Borgard, assisted by a major, a captain, three lieutenants,
and four fireworkers. The medical staff, a surgeon and his
assistant, received a little more remuneration than in former
trains; their daily pay—which to a modern ear has a very
legal sound—being respectively 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> and 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> There
were seven non-commissioned officers, twenty gunners, forty
matrosses, two drummers, and ten artificers. Engineers,
conductors, drivers, and clerks were also present; and on
account of the particular nature of the service on which
the expeditionary force was to be engaged, ten watermen
and a coxswain were included among the attendants of the
train.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, as to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</span></i>:—Borgard selected for his purpose
four 24-pounders, four 9-pounders, and six 1½-pounders,
brass guns, all mounted on travelling carriages, with a
proportion of spare carriages for the first and last, spare
limbers for the second, and spare wheels for all. He also
took a number of brass mortars, six ten-inch, and two eight-inch,
besides thirty Coehorn and twelve Royal mortars. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>ammunition comprised 9800 round shot, 180 grape, 3800
mortar shells, 1000 hand-grenades, and 100 carcasses for the
ten-inch mortars. Two bomb-vessels, each carrying a thirteen-inch
mortar, and with two fireworkers, four bombardiers,
and an artificer on board, accompanied the expedition, and
were also under Colonel Borgard's command.</p>

<p class='c000'>The citadel capitulated on the 10th October, 1719, and a
large quantity of guns and stores fell into the hands of the
English. The first occasion, therefore, on which the Royal
Artillery as a Regiment was represented on active service
was completely successful. The expedition returned to
England in November.</p>

<p class='c000'>One more incident remains to be enlarged upon ere we
leave the gallant officer to tell the story of his own life. In
1716, when attending an experiment at the Foundry in
Windmill Hill, where some brass guns were being recast,
he was wounded in four places by an explosion which took
place, and by which seventeen of the bystanders lost their
lives. The accident had been foretold—so the story goes—by
a young Swiss named Schalch, who was thereupon invited,
after his prophecy was fulfilled, to assist the Board of
Ordnance in selecting a suitable place near London where
all the guns required for the service might be cast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Schalch's hands were rather tied in the matter; for
he was limited to a radius of twelve miles round London.
Had this not been the case, it is hardly probable that he
would have named as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Depôt</span> for national Artillery Stores,
and as the National Arsenal—both of which he must have
foreseen the place of his selection would become—a place so
exposed as Woolwich. As it was, however, being limited to
so small an area, his selection was a natural one for other
than the reasons which would first occur to him, as it already
had a special connection with Artillery manufactures, and
with that Board under whose orders he was to work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few countries, and fewer Boards, have ever had a more
faithful servant than he proved. As Superintendent of
the Foundries, which were built at his suggestion, he lived
for sixty years, "during which time not a single accident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>"occurred."<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The Royal Artillery may well be proud of such
a man, who, although not in the Regiment, was so intimately
connected with it by the nature of his duties; and as all the
management of the various departments in the Arsenal is
in the hands of officers of the Regiment now, there is no
better model for them to study than this father, so to speak,
of Woolwich Arsenal. And the interest which must be felt
in him for his own skill and services is increased by the
knowledge that no less than six of his descendants have
held commissions in the Royal Artillery.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>Appended to the chapter will now be found the diary of
Borgard, to which allusion has so often been made, copied
from a manuscript in the Royal Artillery Regimental Library.
In addition to the short account of his services, it contains
lists of the various battles and sieges in which he took part,
and the dates of his various commissions.</p>

<p class='c000'>"An Account of the Battels, Sieges, &amp;c., wherein Lieutenant-General
Albert Borgard hath served, with what
time and station, and in what Prince's service, as also the
dates of his commissions during the time of his being in
the English service, viz.—</p>

<p class='c014'>"In the <span class='sc'>King of Denmark's</span> Service.</p>

<p class='c014'>1675. "Served as a cadet in the Queen's Regiment of
Foot, and was at the siege of Wismar (a town in the territories
of Mecklenburg), then belonging to the Sweeds,
which was taken by the Danes in the said year in the
month of December."</p>

<p class='c014'>1676. "Was ordered from the Army with a Detachment
of Foot on board the Fleet. A battle was fought with the
Sweeds near Oeland in the Baltick, the 11th of June,
wherein the Danes obtained a compleat victory. With the
aforesaid Detachment in the month of July we landed in
Schonen, and joyned the Danish Army at the Siege of the
Castle at Helsingborg, which place the Danes took from
the Sweeds in the said month by capitulation.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>"Marched from thence, and was at the Siege of the Town
and Castle of Landskroon. One night the Sweeds made a
great sally out of the Town with Horse and Foot; the
Danes beat them back, and followed them into the town
and took it sword in hand. The Castle after some days'
bombardment was taken by capitulation.</p>

<p class='c014'>"In the month of August, we marched from Landskroon
to Christianstat, which town was taken from the Sweeds,
sword in hand, some days after it was invested, without
opening trenches. The Garrison did consist of near 3000
men, which were all cut to pieces. Liberty for three
hours' time was granted to the soldiers to plunder the
town, where there was found a great deal of riches and
treasure.</p>

<p class='c014'>"In the latter end of August, I was one of the 4000 men
of the Army which marched from Christianstat to besiege
the Town Halmstat. Upon their march they were intercepted
and totally defeated by the Sweeds, of which number
not above 700 men made their escape.</p>

<p class='c014'>"In the month of September, several young men that
were well recommended were taken out of the Foot Regiments
to be made gunners of y<sup>e</sup> Artillery, of which I was
one of the number, and served as such in the great Battle
of Lund (in the month of December) between the Sweeds
and the Danes, which continued from sun-rising to sun-setting.
This was counted a drawn battle, because both
Army's Artillery remained in the field that night.</p>

<p class='c014'>1677. "I likewise served as a gunner in the Battle fought
between the Sweeds and the Danes, near Sierkiobing or
Ronneberg, two leagues from Landskroon, in the month of
July, where the Sweeds had a compleat victory. In the
latter end of the same month I was ordered from Schonen
with more gunners to the Siege of Mastraud, in Norway.
In the month of July, the Town with a little Fort was
attacked and taken sword in hand, and two other Castles
near the same place were taken by capitulation. In the
latter end of August we marched with a body of the Norwegian
Army, and fell in the night-time on the Sweeds at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Odewald, beat them, and took from them twelve pieces of
cannon, and all their baggage.</p>

<p class='c014'>1678. "In the month of September, a great Detachment
of the Danish Army, where I was one of the number, was
ordered in the expedition to the Island of Lauterugen, in
the Baltick. We landed on the said Island, though we
mett with great opposition from the Sweeds. We beat
them and obliged them to retire to Stralsund.</p>

<p class='c014'>1679. "I was made a Fireworker, and ordered on a survey
of the Island of Sealand, in Denmark.</p>

<p class='c014'>1680. "I with another Fireworker was ordered to Berlin
in exchange of two Brandenburgher Fireworkers, sent to
Denmark to learn the difference of each nation's work
relating to all sorts of warlike and pleasaunt Fireworks.</p>

<p class='c014'>1681. "I was ordered to go from Berlin to Strasburg to
perfect myself in all things relating to Fortification.</p>

<p class='c014'>1682. "I was ordered back again from Strasburg to Gluckstadt,
in Holstein, where I was made Ensign in the Queen's
Regiment of Foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>1683. "I was made a Lieutenant in the same Regiment,
and ordered with the Duke of Wirtemberg, who went a
voluntier to the relief of Vienna, in Austria, where I was
in the Battle fought by the Germans and Poles against
the Turks the 11th day of September. The Turks were
totally defeated with the loss of their Artillery and greatest
part of their baggage.</p>

<p class='c014'>1684. "I was ordered with several other engineers under
Colonel Scholten's command to fortifie a place called Farrell,
in the County of Oldenburg.</p>

<p class='c014'>1685. "I was ordered by the aforesaid Duke of Wirtemberg,
who went a voluntier to Hungary, and was both of
us at the Siege of Niewhausel and the Battle of Grau in
the month of August. The Germans beat the Turks, and
took twenty-three pieces of cannon, with some of their baggage,
and some days after the battle, Niewhausel was taken
sword in hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>1686. "I went as a voluntier to Hungary, and was at
the Siege of Buda, and was recommended to Colonel Barner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Commander of the Imperial Artillery, who employ'd me
during the Siege, in the Artillery service. The lower town
was taken in June without opposition. The upper town
and castle were taken sword in hand in the month of September.
Here I got so much plunder that paid for all my
campaign done in Hungary as a voluntier.</p>

<p class='c014'>1687. "I was made a Lieutenant in the King of Denmark's
Drabenten Guards, and was employed as Engineer
in the new Fortifications made at Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c014'>1688. "I quitted the Danish Service on account of some
injustice done me in my promotion, and went as voluntier
to Poland. I was well recommended to his Polish Majesty.
I was in the action that happen'd at Budjack, when the
Poles beat the Tartars, and killed and took prisoners to
the number of 2400. Here I took for my share two Tartars
prisoners, which had near cost me my life, by reason I
would not deliver them over to a Polish officer.</p>

<p class='c014'>"In the <span class='sc'>King of Prussia's</span> Service.</p>

<p class='c014'>1689. "In the month of January I was made a Lieutenant
in the Prussian Guards, and the same year went
with my Colonel, Baron Truckis, who made a campaign as
voluntier on the Rhine. I was in the month of March in
action of Niews, a little town between Keyserwart and
Cologne, where the Brandenburghers totally beat the
French and took all their baggage. In the month of June
I was at the Siege of Keyserwart, which place the Brandenburghers,
after some days' bombardment, took from the
French by capitulation. In the month of July we marched
with the Army from Keyserwart to invest the town of
Bonn, which place was without intermission eight nights
and days bombarded, and totally destroyed. After the
bombardment it was kept blockaded till the month of
September. In this bombardment I commanded two
mortars ordered me by Colonel Wyller, commander of the
Prussian Artillery. In the month of August I went from
Bonn to Mentz, a town besieged by the Emperour's and
Allies' Army. In the taking of the Counterscarps or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Glacies of this place, it cost us near 4000 men, by which
means the town was obliged to capitulate. In the month
of September the Duke of Lorrain went with 10,000 men
from Mentz, to reinforce the Allies' Army at Bonn. By
his arrival there the attack was regularly carried on, in
which service I was employed as Engineer, under the direction
of Colonel Gore, who had the direction of the trenches
carried on by the Dutch forces. The Counterscarps or
Glacies, with a ravelin and a counterguard, were taken
sword in hand with the loss of 3000 men. The enemy was
beat into the town, which obliged them in two days' after
to capitulate.</p>

<p class='c014'>1691. "In the month of March 8000 of the Prussian
troops were ordered to Hungary. The company to which
I belonged was included in this number. We joined the
Emperour's Army in the month of June, and we fought a
Battle with the Turks at a place called Solankeman, where
we beat them totally, and took upwards of 100 pieces of
cannon, with a great part of their baggage, in the month
of August.</p>

<p class='c014'>1692. "I quitted the Prussian service, and agreed with
Count de Dohna for a Company of Foot, in a Regiment of
Foot he was to raise for the service of the Emperour.
After some weeks spent in raising men for my company,
the capitulation broke off, because the Emperour would
not agree to the terms stipulated with the said Count. In
the month of April I went from the city of Dantzick to
Holland, and from thence in company with some Danish
voluntiers to y<sup>e</sup> Siege of Namur. After the siege I went
from Namur to the English and Allies' camp at Melle, and
from thence I marched with the Army to the camp at
Genap, where in the month of July I entered as Firemaster
into the English Artillery, under the command of Colonel
Gore.</p>

<p class='c014'>"In the <span class='sc'>English</span> Service.</p>

<p class='c014'>1692. "I marched with the English Artillery to the
Battle of Steenkirke, and after the battle was ordered
with a Detachment of Fireworkers to joyn at Ostend those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Artillery people which came from England under the
command of Sir Martin Beckman. From Ostend we
marched to Tourney, from thence to Dixmud, and at last
to quarter at Ghent.</p>

<p class='c014'>1693. "I was commanded with a Detachment of Fireworkers
and Bombardiers to Liege, and from thence back
again to Nearhespe, where we fought the battle of Landen,
and where our Army was beat, and sixty-three pieces of
English cannon lost. After the battle I was ordered with
a detachment of Fireworkers to Sasvangand, in order to
embark the great Artillery for a secret expedition; after
some days' labour was ordered back again to the Army
encamped at Nuioven, from thence into Flanders.</p>

<p class='c014'>1694. "I went with my Lieutenant-Colonel Browne to
the Siege of Huy, which place we took from the French
in the month of September, by capitulation.</p>

<p class='c014'>1695. "I was ordered with some mortars to follow the
Duke of Wirtemberg, who commanded a detachment of the
Army at Fort Knock invested by the said Duke. From
thence I was ordered with a detachment of the Artillery
to the Siege of Namur, which place I bombarded with
twelve great mortars, and did throw about 4000 bombs
(into the town, Cohorn's Work, and Terra Nova), before
the siege was over. The town capitulated in August, and
Cohorn's Work and Terra Nova in September.</p>

<p class='c014'>1696. "Nothing material was done this year but making
intrenchments, marching, and counter-marching with the
Army.</p>

<p class='c014'>1697. "This year was like the former till we encamped
at Brussels, where the cessation of arms was proclaimed....
In the month of September the Army marched
into quarters, where the greatest part of the Artillery
people were ordered to England, foreigners excepted,
who were all discharged except myself and one by name
Schlunt. I was ordered to embark all the English Artillery
remaining in Flanders to be sent to England. I
myself went with the last embarkation in the month of
February."</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>1698 to 1701. "I remained in England without being in
any action.</p>

<p class='c014'>1702. "I was made Major to the Artillery in the bomb
vessels sent on the expedition to Cadiz, under the command
of His Grace the Duke of Ormond and Admiral Rooke. In
this expedition I bombarded with five bomb vessels, first,
St. Catharina, with such success that it capitulated. I
also bombarded with some land mortars the Fort Matagorde.
At our arrival at Vigo, I bombarded with three
bomb vessels Fort Durand, which was taken sword in
hand by the land forces. The Fleet entered and broke the
boom which was laid over the entrance of the harbour near
the said Fort, took and destroyed all the ships of war,
galleons, &amp;c., to the number of thirty-seven.</p>

<p class='c014'>1703. "Went as voluntier to Flanders. After some
months' stay was recalled to England in order to command
the English Artillery ordered to Portugall, with this present
Emperour, being at that time King of Spain. Two
of the transports laden with stores under my command
were lost in the great storm in the Downs, where myself
then rode, and was afterwards obliged to go to Portsmouth
to repair the damage we had received by that storm.</p>

<p class='c014'>1704. "Nothing material done with the Army but
marching and counter-marching.</p>

<p class='c014'>1705. "I was at the Siege of Valencia d'Alcantra, which
the English took from the Spaniards sword in hand. At
this siege, in building the Battery, I had my left arm shot
to pieces.</p>

<p class='c014'>1706. "I was at the Siege of Alcantra, which place the
English and Allies took by capitulation in the month of
April. Here I received a contused wound on my left
breast. Marched from thence to Corea and Plazencia.
Both towns declared for King Charles, and from thence
marched to the Bridge of Almaraz, and so back to Corea
and to Ciudad Rodrigo, which place we besieged and took
by capitulation in the month of May. Marched from thence
to the Town Salamanca, which place declared for King
Charles: from thence to Madrid, which likewise declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>for King Charles, where we encamped ten days. From
Madrid we marched to Guadalaxara; from thence to
Guadraka, where I cannonaded in the month of August
for two days together the Duke of Berwick's Army; from
thence marched back to Guadalaxara, and so on to St.
Jonne, from which place we retreated into the kingdom of
Valencia, where the enemy followed us close till we had
got over the pass at Raguina.</p>

<p class='c014'>1707. "In the month of April we marched from Valencia
to the Battle of Almanza, where our Army was totally
routed, and the remaining part retreated to Toroza in
Catalonia. In this battle we lost all the Portuguese Artillery,
and most part of the Artillery people were taken
prisoners or cut to pieces; and I had the misfortune to
lose all my baggage.</p>

<p class='c014'>1708. "I commanded the Artillery on the expedition
with Major-General Stanhope to the Island of Minorca,
where we landed in September, and after I had built my
battery by which I dismounted the cannon of two of the
enemy's towers built in the line, the Castle of St. Phillip
capitulated in the latter end of October. The whole
Island, at our landing, declared for King Charles, and after
having been three months in regulating the Artillery, I
returned back to Catalonia in the month of February,
1708-9.</p>

<p class='c014'>1709. "Marched with the Artillery to Villa Nova de la
Barkia, on the River Segra, where I bombarded for some
days the enemy's Army, and after our Army had passed
the river, they took the town Balaguar, after two days'
siege, by capitulation.</p>

<p class='c014'>1710. "In the month of July I was at the Battle of
Almenar, where our Army in less than two hours beat
the enemy and encamped in the place of the field of battle
for some days...." "From the camp at Almenar we
marched to besiege the Castle Moncon. We possessed ourselves
the first night of one of the enemy's works that
covered their bridge laid over the Cuica river, and continued
there some days, and at last was obliged to leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the place...." "In August, marched from thence
and passed the said river near Traga in pursuit of the
enemy to the place of Saragoso, where we fought a battle
on the 20th August, got a compleat victory, and took the
greatest part of the enemy's Artillery. Here I received
four wounds, and had upwards of eighty men killed and
wounded on my battery, and above 300 Artillery mules
hamstringed. From this place our Army pursued the
enemy, and marched to Madrid, which declared a second
time for King Charles. Two months after, I was carried
thither, and from thence ordered to Toledo to put that
Artillery, &amp;c., we had taken from the enemy in order; and
after some days' stay was ordered to destroy the said Artillery,
and march to joyn part of the Army in camp at
St. Jonne, from whence we marched in the month of
December, and joyned the whole Army near Villa Viciosa,
where we fought a battle the 10th December with the loss
of all our Artillery, and were obliged to retreat into the
Kingdom of Arragon. I was wounded with a cannon-shot
in my left leg, lost all my baggage, and was taken prisoner
in the town of Siguenca.</p>

<p class='c014'>1711. "I obtained leave upon my parole to go to England,
to be cured of my wound; and after my arrival had
the good fortune to be exchanged for another Colonel
belonging to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c014'>1713. "I made pleasure fireworks which were burnt on
River Thames in the month of August, over against Whitehall,
on the Thanksgiving Day for the Peace made at
Utrecht.</p>

<p class='c014'>1715. "In the month of December I was ordered with
a train of Artillery to Scotland, and arrived in the month
of February in the Firth of Forth by Leith, where I was
ordered by His Grace the Duke of Argyle to send the
vessells with the Artillery to a place called Innerkithen
till further orders, and to march with all the officers and
Artillery people from Edinburgh to Stirling. At Stirling I
was ordered by His Grace to take upon me the command of
fifteen pieces of cannon ordered from Edinburgh, &amp;c., for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>field service, which was in such confusion as cannot be
expressed; part of which Artillery I brought so far as the
town of Dundee, where I was ordered to bring the Train
back again to Edinburgh by water.</p>

<p class='c014'>1716. "In the month of March I was ordered by General
Cadogan, in His Grace the Duke of Argyle's absence, to
send the vessells with the Artillery back again to London,
and the Train people to march from thence. On our
arrivall at London, I was ordered by the Board of Ordnance
to lay before them tables and draughts of all natures
of brass and iron cannon, mortars, &amp;c., which was done
accordingly and approved of. After the said draughts,
two 24-pounder brass cannon were ordered to be cast by
Mr. Bagley in his Foundry at Windmill Hill, at the casting
of which I was ordered to be present. In the founding,
the metal of one of the gunns blow'd into the air, burnt
many of the spectators, of which seventeen dy'd out of
twenty-five persons, and myself received four wounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>1717, 1718. "The Board came to a resolution to regulate
what was wanting to compleat a compleat Artillery for
sea and land service. I had an order to lay before them
draughts of all natures of carriages, wheels, trucks, grapes,
and matted shot, and all sorts of bombs both great and
small for land and sea service, with a great many other
things relating to an Artillery too tedious to mention,
which they approved of. I likewise laid before the Board
the ill-state of the Laboratory, which the Board order'd
me to put in some better order, and to be at as little
expence as possible, which I did accordingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>1719. "I was ordered on the expedition to Vigo, which
place I bombarded with forty-six great and small mortars
of my own projection, which answered their intended end,
of which my Lord Cobham, and the rest of the generall
officers can give a better account than myself, by which
bombardment the Castle of Vigo was obliged in the month
of October to surrender.</p>

<p class='c014'>1720 to 1722. "I attended the Service, as formerly, at
all surveys, &amp;c., relating to the Artillery till such time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Colonel Armstrong was made Surveyor, after which time,
notwithstanding His Majesty's signification to me for regulating
the Artillery for sea and land service, I was never
consulted in anything relating to the said service.</p>

<p class='c014'>"His late Majesty was graciously pleased to renew my
old commission as Colonel, and to give me the command of
the Regiment of Artillery established for His service, consisting
of four companys."<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='sc'>Twenty Years.</span> 1722-1741.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Twenty</span> years, during which Englishmen made no
conquests; but during which they had "peace, ease,
and freedom; the Three per Cents, nearly at par; and
wheat at five- and six-and-twenty shillings a quarter."<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Twenty years, during which England's army did not
exceed 26,000 men; when there was actually a war of
succession in Europe, and our rulers did not interfere; during
which our King could go to Hanover for a couple of years,
and the coach of the State move on steadily and without
interruption in his absence; and during which our only
alarms of war were two in number, and speedily disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a favourable childhood for the Regiment; it gave
time for the old establishments to dwindle away, and the
new one to acquire consistency and strength with the funds
which thus became available at the Ordnance; instruction to
officers and men could be deliberately and systematically
given; discipline could be learnt; the fortifications could be
armed; and the defects of the original scheme of organization
in the Regiment could be ascertained and quietly
remedied, instead of being more rudely exposed in time of
war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only three events occurred between 1722 and 1741, which
are worthy of comment; but there are details connected with
the every-day life of the Royal Artillery during that period,
which, though unworthy of being called events, yet cannot
but be interesting to the student.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first was the camp at Hyde Park, in 1723, which was
attended by a train of Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The second was in 1727, when the Spaniards laid siege to
Gibraltar; a siege, however, which only lasted four months.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third was in the same year, when the States-General
of Holland, becoming nervous lest an attempt should be made
on the Netherlands, called upon England to hold in readiness
the contingent of 10,000, which she was bound by treaty
to furnish, if required. For this, a train of Artillery was
ordered to be prepared, and although not required, pacific
counsels having prevailed in Europe, its constitution is
worthy of mention.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the camp at Hyde Park, held the year after the Regiment
obtained its Colonel, probably for the amusement of the
Londoners, there was a train of Artillery of twenty pieces
of Ordnance, comprising two 6-pounders, four 3-pounders,
and fourteen 1½-pounders. This battery was horsed by
seventy-six horses, but the detail to the various natures of
Ordnance cannot be traced. The officers and men attached
to the battery were as follows: 1 captain, 1 lieutenant,
1 fireworker, 2 sergeants, 4 corporals and bombardiers, 20
gunners, 40 matrosses, and two drummers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Infantry was called upon to furnish a guard over the
guns when parked, of twenty-five men. Six regiments of
Dragoons, and twelve of Infantry of the Line, attended the
camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1727, the bad feeling, which had for some time existed
between England and Spain, produced an open rupture. A
force of 20,000 Spaniards besieged Gibraltar, opening their
trenches on the 11th of February. By means of reinforcements
from England and Minorca, the garrison was increased
to 6000 men, and the bomb-vessels, which were sent from
England and from other parts of the Mediterranean, rendered
great assistance by enfilading the enemy's entrenchments.
The siege was raised on the 23rd June, having only lasted four
months, during which time the Spanish loss had been great,
while that of the English had been inconsiderable. With
the reinforcements from England had come some guns and
stores, which assisted to make the fort more easily defended,
its previous armament having been but indifferent. Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Jonas Watson commanded the Royal Artillery during the
siege, having arrived for that purpose from England, accompanied
by Captain Hughes and some young officers. The
force under his command was two hundred in number.
The only Artillery officer killed during the siege was Captain-Lieutenant
Holman.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this the first defensive operation in which the Royal
Regiment of Artillery was engaged—as in its first offensive
at Vigo—it was on the successful side. And in both cases,
it not merely represented, but it <em>was</em> the principal arm
of the English forces. The next event, the third proposed
to be chronicled, took place in the same year. The train
which it was deemed probable would have to proceed to
Flanders was for field, not garrison service. It comprised
four 6-pounders, twelve 3-pounders, and eight 1½-pounders.
There were also six Royal mortars to be provided. A complete
company of Artillery—with the exception of the cadets
of the company, and nine of its bombardiers—attended the
train, and 12 artificers and 22 pontoon-men, under a bridgemaster,
were also ordered to accompany it. Conductors and
commissaries were also included. Unless, however, it was
proposed to enlist foreign Artillerymen into the British
service, on landing in the Continent,—the staff of the train
seems certainly excessive.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a total of 140 of all ranks—smaller than a single
battery now—the following staff was detailed: 1 colonel,
1 comptroller, 1 paymaster, 1 adjutant, 1 chaplain, 1 quartermaster,
1 commissary of stores, 1 waggon master, 1 surgeon,
1 assistant-surgeon, 1 assistant provost-marshal, 1 kettledrummer
and his coachman.</p>

<p class='c000'>These, then, were the three military events of most note
during the twenty years ending in 1741; and they are certainly
not such as to affect the peaceable reputation of the
period. An unhappy expedition to the West Indies, under
Lord Cathcart, was ordered in 1741, but as it was not completed
until later, it can be alluded to more fully in a
succeeding chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the domestic life of the Regiment during this time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>requires description. The rank of Captain-Lieutenant had
been introduced in 1720, and the third and fourth Lieutenant
of a company were called Lieutenants and Fireworkers, the
conjunction being speedily dropped. The strength of a company
was during this period as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The annual pay of each company amounted to 2956<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>It was in 1727, that the Regiment was increased to four
complete companies. The siege of Gibraltar suggested an
augmentation which the declining numbers on the old establishment
admitted of the Board carrying out. On this
taking place, the staff requisite for the Regiment was added,
and Colonel Borgard was styled Colonel-Commandant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The staff consisted, in addition to the Colonel, of a Lieutenant-Colonel—Jonas
Watson; a Major—William Bousfield;
an Adjutant, a Quartermaster, and a Bridge-Master. To
meet the demand for the more scientific element in the new
companies, one Second Lieutenant and one Fireworker per
company were transferred from the old, and the number of
bombardiers and gunners in each reduced to eight and twenty
respectively. The matrosses, as being more easily obtained,
and requiring less special training, were increased to sixty-four
per company; and from this time vacancies among the
gunners were filled by the most deserving matrosses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The large number of junior officers and of bombardiers
in each company was intended to meet the demands of the
bomb-service, which even in this peaceable time were very
heavy: more especially for the bomb-vessels in the Mediterranean.
It created, however, an evil which must always be
found in a profession where the junior ranks so greatly outnumber
the senior, and where the prizes are so few, while the
candidates are many;—the evil of slow promotion and even
stagnation, and in their wake, discontent, loss of zeal, and, at
last, indifference. So soon did this manifest itself, that by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>reducing the number of junior officers, and increasing that of
the seniors, it has been repeatedly attempted to remedy it;
the last attempt being so recent as during the tenancy of the
present Secretary of State for War—Mr. Cardwell. But this
remedy has its limits. There are duties to be performed
suitable only to inferior military rank, and the performance
of which, by senior officers, would have the effect of degrading
the rank to which they may have attained. A considerable
proportion of an army's officers, therefore, must always
hold inferior military rank; but whether the evil which
accompanies stagnation in their ranks is to be remedied by
increase of pay in proportion to service, or by enforced retirement
in the upper ranks, is one of those questions which
it is not for the historian to argue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Captains of the four companies of the Regiment after
the augmentation were</p>

      <div class='line'>and Captain <span class='sc'>Thomas Pattison</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The first-mentioned two were at Woolwich with their
companies, although compelled to furnish detachments for
Scotland and the bombs; the third was at Gibraltar, and
the fourth in Minorca. Special establishments still existed
for Annapolis and Placentia. The pay per diem of an Artillery
Captain was 10<em>s.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>It was in Minorca that the question of the military precedence
of Artillery officers was first authoritatively settled.
The officers of the four Infantry Regiments stationed there
having refused to sit on courts-martial on the same terms as
the officers of the train, the matter was referred to England,
and by order of the King the Secretary at War informed the
commandant at Port Mahon that whenever any of the Artillery
were being tried, the officers of the train were to sit and
vote with other officers of the Army, according to the dates
of their commissions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The objection taken by the Infantry officers was doubtless
based on the fact that until 1751 the commissions of Artillery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>officers under the rank of field officer were signed by the
Master-General, not by the King. This decision, however,
settled the point effectually; and ten years later there is a
record of the trial by court-martial in London of a deserter
from the Artillery in which all the members of the Court
were officers of the Guards, and the president belonged to
the Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the places which were supplied with additional
armament during this time of rest were Berwick, Plymouth,
Portsmouth, and Hull, but the charge of the Ordnance and
Stores still remained in the hands of the master-gunners
and gunners of Garrisons, numbering at this time respectively
41 and 178. The value of these officials may be estimated
by a description of certain accepted candidates for the appointment
in 1725, who were "superannuated and disabled
gunners, who have served long and well, and being too
feeble for active service, are subsisted until they can be
placed in the garrisons."</p>

<p class='c000'>An augmentation to the companies was commenced in 1739,
but not completed until the following year, when one new
company was raised; the strength of the companies at home
being increased to 150, and of those at Minorca and Gibraltar
to 100. It was 1741 before the distribution of the companies
at home was finally arranged; for it was found necessary to
divide the three into four, for purposes of relief and detachment.
At this time,—the end of the twenty years, the
strength of the Regiment at home, in addition to the companies
abroad, amounted to thirty-five officers, eighty non-commissioned
officers, of whom fifty-six were bombardiers,
twenty miners, ninety-two gunners, thirty-two pontoon-men,
184 matrosses, and eight drummers.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also sixteen cadet-gunners, and sixteen cadet-matrosses,
the number in each of the four home companies
having been reduced to four. It was from the cadets that the
lieutenant-fireworkers were generally, although not always,
chosen. The employment of officers of that rank on board
the bomb-vessels without superior officers above them rendered
it necessary often to promote non-commissioned officers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>whose experience would enable them to carry on such an
independent service, better than the young and inexperienced
fireworkers, just promoted from among the cadets. The
discipline among these young gentlemen may be gathered
from the marginal remarks of the commanding officer on
the muster-rolls of the two companies at Woolwich in 1739.
After alluding to one officer as having been lame for six
months, and to another as having lost his memory, and
done no duty for seven years, he comes to the cadets of the
companies. Out of the whole number of sixteen, there is a
remark against the names of no less than nine, "I know not
where they are," and against another, "A very idle fellow!"
The remaining six were detached, two at Portsmouth, one in
the Tower, one on board the bombs, and only two at Woolwich.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is in the same list a remark made against the name
of one, Captain-Lieutenant George Minnies, which might
justly have been made against others of the same rank in
later days, if indeed it may not also have to be made again,
"old and worn-out in the service."</p>

<p class='c000'>The end of this period brings us near to that time when
the Regiment, having quitted the nursery, so to speak,
entered the school of war, which was provided for it in
Flanders. Before, however, tracing its story then, it will
be well to describe some little matters connected with the
foundation and early history of an institution which was
founded in 1741, the last of our twenty years, to meet a
want, which the above comments of the commanding officer
must prove most distinctly to have existed.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='sc'>Foundation of the Royal Military Academy.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>From</span> what was mentioned in the last chapter, it will be
seen that there were cadets long before there was an
Academy. Although, however, this institution is of a date
so long posterior to the formation of the Regiment, and
although by many of the practical officers serving when
it was founded, who had acquired their knowledge in the
school of experience, it was looked upon very coldly, as a
useless and undesirable innovation,—yet no History of the
Royal Artillery would be complete without some reference
to its early days. For, although often mismanaged, and even
now almost paralysed as an Artillery school by the marvellous
arrangement under which the best Artillery scholars are
invited to join the Royal Engineers, it has yet acquired such
a hold upon the affections of those who have been there,
as to ensure it a prominent place among our Regimental
Records.</p>

<p class='c000'>The warrant founding the Academy was issued in 1741.
The cadets then in the Regiment were to be instructed there,
but not these only; it was to be available for the professional
education of all "the raw and inexperienced people belonging
to the military branch of the Ordnance." At first, the
sum proposed to be voted annually for its support was merely
500<em>l.</em>, but this was almost immediately doubled, and before
1771 it had reached 1364<em>l.</em> 14<em>s.</em> From the very first the
practical and theoretical schools were distinct. The former
was attended not merely by the cadets, but also by all
officers and men off duty; the latter by all above the rank of
bombardier, as well as any below that rank who had evinced
any special talent, or capacity for study. In the Theoretical
School, pure and mixed mathematics were taught; in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Practical School, the various gun drills, fortification, laboratory
duties, &amp;c. Once a year there was performed before
the Master-General, or his lieutenant, "a great and solemn
exercise of Artillery, in which exercise those who were
best advanced in the several classes shot with different
pieces of Ordnance at several marks according to their
different proficiencies, or produced some other specimen of
their diligence and application in their study of fortification,
drawing, &amp;c., when he who best distinguished
himself in each class was presented with some prize of
honour—if an engineer, officer, or cadet—or some pecuniary
premium, if a private man, as an encouragement."</p>

<p class='c000'>It will thus be seen that from the earliest days there was
no finality in the education acquired by a cadet at the Academy.
His training was not supposed to cease when he was
commissioned. It is well to remember this at a time when
there are not wanting men to decry the continuous education
of Artillery officers, and to express perfect contentment
with the amount of Artillery education obtained at the
Academy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably these very men who deem Artillery an exact and
finite science to be mastered by a boy in his teens, would be
the first to protest against the idea that a man could master
the intricacies of the stable, without many years of progressive
and practical experience. Chemistry as applied to the service
of Ordnance, dynamics, metallurgy, might be sufficiently
conquered at the Academy, or might be conscientiously dispensed
with, but the perambulation of a horse infirmary might
go on for a lifetime, and yet a man's education be incomplete.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best friend to his corps is the man who denies and
scorns such a theory. National predilections have made
and will continue to make the horsing of the English Artillery
the best in the world, but the gun must not be lost
sight of in devotion to the horse. And this once recognized,
from that moment an Artilleryman, to be conscientious and
progressive, must be studious. At the altar of science he
should be the most regular votary; for gunnery, to be perfect,
draws incessantly and largely upon science.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>In the early days of the Regiment, an officer might master
in a short time the requisite details for working his guns.
In the present day, an Artilleryman is unworthy who fails
to watch every scientific advance which may increase the
power of his weapons, and raise the tone of his corps. And
to enable the officers of the Regiment to do their duty in
this respect, no effort for continued exertion and study should
be spared; mutual interchange of ideas should be fostered;
and the main use of Artillery as an arm should not be concealed
behind a veil of pipeclay and harness-polish. The
merits which these last-named agents are calculated to
foster will come almost spontaneously: it is the study of the
higher uses, and of the scientific progress of Artillery over
the world, which requires persuasion and encouragement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Academy, as we have said, was founded in 1741. Not
until four years later was the cadet company formed. During
the interval, as before the institution of the Academy, the
cadets were under no discipline worthy of the name; they
wore no uniform, and were so outrageous in study, that one
of the occupations of the officer on duty in the Warren was
occasionally to visit the Academy, and prevent the masters
from being ill-used, and even pelted. When, in June 1744,
the Regiment was inspected by the Duke of Cumberland, a
disorderly mob, without officers, or even uniform, drawn up
on the right of the line, represented the cadets of the Royal
Artillery. Let no man say that ceremonial inspections
are useless. Defects, which are not apparent in every-day
life, stare one in the face, as one stands behind the individual
whose office it is to criticise. The readiest critic is he who is
most interested on such an occasion. He is not the most
demonstrative; he is glad beyond measure if the blot escapes
the inspecting eye; but he remembers. And to such a man
remembrance means remedy. Next January, the cadets were
no longer a mob; they were no longer unofficered: they were
clothed, but they were not yet in their right mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be said of the Cadets of the olden time, that they
were veritable sons of Ishmael; their hands were against
every man, and every man's hand against them. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the parents of their own legislation; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i> law-making
was unknown; and not a statute was passed that had not
been anticipated by the offence it was intended to curb.
The cadets' ingenuity in evading detection was equalled by
their talent in inventing new methods of annoyance. This
talent was too often aided by the connivance of the newly-commissioned
officers, whose sympathies were more with the
law-breakers they had left than the law-insisters they had
joined. Hence came threats fulminated against an intimacy
between cadets and young officers, which made such intercourse
all the sweeter; nor was it effectually put an end to
until the Academy was removed from the Barracks in the
Warren to a secluded spot at the foot of Shooter's Hill.
The extreme youth of the cadets in the earlier days of the
Academy, coupled with the very different views then in
vogue as to educational discipline, produced a system of
government which was harsh and penal. The Royal Military
Academy has gone through two stages—the era of stern
restriction, and that of comparative liberty. The swing of
the pendulum is as certain in military as in civil life. From
the days of black holes and bullying, the reaction to liberty,
confidence in a cadet's honour, thoughtfulness for his comfort,
and a system of punishment not degrading nor unsuited
to his age, were inevitable, and have come. So far, indeed, has
the pendulum swung, that the young officer must occasionally
look back with regret on the greater comfort and the absence
of responsibility which were characteristic of the older life.
The absence of degrading punishments has been brought
about, in great part, by the system of competition for cadet-ships,
which, commencing with the practical class in 1855,
has now for many years been universal. Young men from
public schools, or from private tutors under whom they had
to study <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">proprio motu</span></i>, and without the spur of discipline,
could not be submitted to the same restraints as the mere
boys who were cadets in the earlier days of the Academy.
Nor does their absence lessen the sense of discipline which is
necessary in a military body. The sympathy of numbers is
the strongest wall against which a recalcitrant member can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>dash his head, and the result to the head is proverbial. And
among educated youth, past the stage of mere boyhood,
reasonable restraint and discipline can always be enforced
with full confidence in the support of the governed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extreme youth of the cadets, in the early Academy
days, is the key to the many ludicrous laws and anecdotes
which have come down. For many years the average age of
the cadets was between twelve and fourteen years, and old
heads cannot be expected on young shoulders. As a matter
of fact, old heads were not to be found; and the history of
the Academy, over a hundred years ago, is one of the most
comic narratives which can be perused. The incessant war
going on between the Gulliver of authority and the Lilliputians
of defiance, who so frequently got poor Gulliver on his
back,—the laughable use of unaccustomed power by cadet corporals,
bewildered by their position,—and the grandiloquent
appeals of Governor after Governor to the feelings of rebellious
youth, all combine to make up a rare picture. We
meet threats against cadets who shall pass an officer without
pulling off their hats, or who shall stay away from church,
or shall play during the hours of study. So fond were the
boys of bathing, more especially after it had been forbidden,
that no punishment could deter them, until ingenious
authority decided that any cadet found swimming in the
Thames should be taken out and carried naked to the
guard-room. Special punishments were devised for those
who should wear officers' uniforms for the purpose of
getting past the guard at the Warren gate, and for those
who should break out over the wall after tattoo, or
spoil the furniture, or write upon the walls. Nor is it
merely the extreme youth of the cadets which is revealed
by these orders; it is their incessant repetition, month after
month, day after day, that makes the student detect the
utter want of discipline that existed. A record remains of
a cadet who was expelled for striking and maltreating
another on parade, in presence of an officer, and "refusing
to make any concession, although urged to do so by the
Lieutenant-Governor." Two others are described in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>official report as "scabby sheep, whom neither lenity will
improve, nor confinement to a dark room and being fed on
bread and water." These two, having openly displayed
contempt of orders and defiance of authority, were dismissed
ultimately from the Academy. Another, on whom the same
penalty of expulsion fell, rather checkmated the authorities
by taking with him his cadet's uniform and warrant, which
enabled him to create such disturbances in the town of
Woolwich, that he had to be threatened with the civil power
if he did not give up the one and discontinue wearing the
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the orders which it was found necessary to issue
can be read most succinctly the account of life among the
earlier cadets.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Gentlemen Cadets are now strictly forbid to cut or
carve their names, or initial letters of names, on any
part of their desks, or any way to spoil them....
They are not to spoil their own locks, or those of any other
Gentlemen Cadets, by attempting to open them with
wrong keys.... The Lieutenant-Governor expects
that henceforward no Gentleman Cadet will be guilty
of ever attempting to open or spoil any of the desks
or drawers of the Inspectors, Professors, or Masters, or of
any other Cadet, or even attempt to take anything out of
them under the name of <em>smouching</em>, as they may be fully
assured such base and vile crimes will be pardoned no more.
The Gentlemen Cadets are, likewise, forbid from leaping
upon or running over the desks with their feet; and the
Corporals are expected, not only to keep a watchful eye
to prevent any disorder in the Academy, but, by their own
good behaviour, to set an example to others."</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after this order a remonstrance is published,
arguing that "the cadets have been guilty of a habit of
making a continued noise, and going about greatly disturbing
the Masters in their teaching; also, when the
Academy ends, by shutting their desks with violence, and
running out of the Academy hallooing, shouting, and
making such a scene of riot and dissipation, greatly unbecoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>a Seminary of learning, and far beneath the name
of a Gentleman Cadet; and, lastly, during the hours of
dancing, several of the Under Academy, whose names are
well known, behave at present in so unpardonable a manner
when dancing, by pulling, and hauling, and stamping, that
the Master is thereby prevented from teaching. Hence
the Lieutenant-Governor assures the gentlemen that those,
who are anyways found guilty of such conduct for the
future will be immediately sent to the Barracks, and
receive such <em>corporal</em> punishment as their crimes deserve."</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet again in stately language, it is reported that "it
had come to the ears of the Lieutenant-Governor that of
late the Corporals have inflicted a mode of punishment
entirely inconsistent with the Rules and Regulations of the
Academy—namely, that of making the Gentlemen kneel
down on both knees, with uplifted hands, in the attitude
of prayer; at other times placing them in painful and
ridiculous postures, rather tending to excite laughter than
to inflict punishment. The Lieutenant-Governor henceforward
forbids all such modes of proceeding, as also that
of striking the Cadets. On the contrary, when any Cadet
is thought deserving of punishment, the Corporals may
order them to stand sentinel, or report them to the Master
on duty, or, with his leave, march them to the Barracks,
and report them to the Commanding Officer in writing,
who may punish them according to their crimes. On the
other hand, the Lieutenant-Governor expects the Gentlemen
Cadets to obey the Corporal's commands equally the
same as any other superior officer, subordination being the
most essential part of military duty. Lastly, the Lieutenant-Governor
expresses the highest satisfaction in the
genteel behaviour of the Company during the hours of
dancing, in a great measure owing to the care of the present
Corporals."</p>

<p class='c000'>These extracts are sufficient proof of the youth and unruly
habits of the earlier cadets. Courts-martial among them
were far from uncommon; and cases of disturbance worthy
of the name of mutiny are also recorded. Yet, in the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>earliest days of the Academy, officers joined the Regiment
who entered with such spirit and zeal into their duties, that
they called forth special commendation from their commanding
officers. In Flanders, in 1747 and 1748, Colonel Belford
and Major Michelson warmly acknowledged the assistance
they received from the young officers in their arduous
attempts to impart to the Artillery Train a more military
appearance than had hitherto distinguished it. And when,
some years later, we find this very Colonel Belford protesting
against the officers who joined from the Academy, and wishing
that Institution were "detached as a Repository for Captain
Congreve's curiosities, and that a number of fine young
fellows were appointed as Cadets to every Battalion, and
such as were fit for every duty to go upon all commands,"
we must bear in mind that, so great had the demand for
officers been in the years immediately preceding his complaint,
that the cadets had hardly any time to spend at the
Academy—three or four months only being far from unusual,
and, therefore, that the fault lay not so much in the system
as in its neglect. A lad of eighteen years of age will be able
to acquire even discipline in a very short time, because he is
able to understand its necessity, and he soon becomes a creature
of habit in this as in other matters. But a boy is always,
either from restlessness or mischief, chafing against restraint,
and takes longer time to subdue. The extreme youth of the
earlier cadets prevents surprise at the ludicrous state of discipline
which prevailed, and creates wonder that the officers
who joined so young, after such a training, were so good as
they proved. If the truth were known, we should, doubtless,
find that, while their intellectual training commenced at the
Academy, their real discipline did not commence until they
joined the Regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not merely did the exigencies of the service curtail the
stay of the earlier cadets at the Academy, but the abuses
and jobbery which were rife in the last century rendered it
possible for cadets to be at the Academy without any previous
education at all. With a proclamation hanging on
the wall that the Institution was created for teaching the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>"Mathematicks," we find piteous Masters protesting against
the presence of cadets who could neither read nor write.
There were cadets,—not in the Academy, but away in their
homes,—drawing pay as such almost from their cradle; and
not until the Academy had been a considerable time in
existence was this abuse put an end to. Before the formation
of the Company of Cadets, the pay of a Cadet Gunner was
1<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> per diem; that of a Cadet Matross was 1<em>s.</em> When
the company was formed, all cadets received the higher rate;
and ultimately, although not until twenty years had passed,
the pay was raised to 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> When enrolled in a company,
military duties were expected of them which were never dreamt
of before: they carried arms, and mounted guard, the post
where the cadet-sentry was placed being generally over the
commanding officer's quarters. The officers of the company—in
addition to the Master-General, who was its captain—were
a Captain-Lieutenant, whose daily pay was 1<em>l.</em> 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>;
a First Lieutenant, with 5<em>s.</em>; a Second Lieutenant, with 4<em>s.</em>;
and a Fireworker, with 3<em>s.</em> But it was not for some time
after its formation that the officers of the company were
borne as supernumeraries in the Regiment. A Drum-major
was also on the strength of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of cadets in the company, which had been
almost immediately increased from forty to forty-eight,
varied with the demands on the Academy during different
wars. At the end of last century, and the beginning of the
present, so heavy were the wants of the Regiment, and of
the East India Company's service, that accommodation for
cadets had to be sought for in the various private schools in
Woolwich and its vicinity, and even in the Military College
at Marlow. With the opening of the new Academy in 1806
this necessity gradually disappeared, the Government accommodation
being sufficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the cadets of the company, the Academy was
attended by supernumeraries in the earlier days, who were
permitted to study there pending vacancies. Certain students,
also known as gentlemen attendants, who did not meditate
joining the Army, but attended for general education, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>permitted to avail themselves of the services of the Academy
Masters by paying the annual sum of thirty guineas.
Classics were taught as well as mathematics, at the schools
in the Warren; and, in fact, Woolwich was used by these
gentlemen attendants, much as West Point is used in America
by students who recognize the value of the education imparted
there, but do not contemplate entering the military
profession.</p>

<p class='c000'>This suggests allusion to the Academy Masters in the
olden time. It must be admitted that, in point of discipline
and obedience to authority, the example set by the Masters
to the pupils was far from beneficial. They resented military
interference. They brooded over real and fancied slights.
They absented themselves without permission; and their
letters to the Lieutenant-Governor were not unfrequently
impertinent. The case was at one time serious. But
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Custodes quis custodiet ipsos?</span>" At last a man was found
to bell the cat; a man of whom we shall hear again—who
was Lieutenant-Governor in 1776, before going to command
the Artillery in America—James Pattison. A letter which
he addressed to the Mathematical Masters on the 1st April,
1777, shows the line he adopted; and tells the whole story
without any explanation being necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>"<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,—I have received your letter of 27th March,
and the reply I have at present to make to it is principally
to correct two essential mistakes contained in the four
lines which compose the letter. You say, that at my
<em>request</em>, you have subjoined your opinion on the mode of
education in the Academy, and desire me to present it to
the Master-General in <em>your names</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>"The case in my manner of stating it is <em>this</em>. I signified
to you the Master-General's being not well pleased at the
slow progress made by the Gentlemen Cadets in the Mathematics,
and asked if you thought there was room for any
beneficial alteration in the method of teaching in your department.
Upon which you expressed great discontent at
the printed rules you are prescribed to teach by, condemning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>them as being very defective and absurd, and mentioned
several amendments you wished might be allowed to take
place. I thereupon <em>required</em>, not <em>requested</em>, you to represent
them to me in writing, that I might be able to lay
them, if expedient, before the Master-General; <em>not</em> meaning,
as you seem to <em>conceive</em>, to be merely the porter of
them in your names.</p>

<p class='c014'>"As to the temporary suspension of teaching Latin in the
Lower Academy, it being by the Master-General's orders,
his lordship will judge how far the manner in which you
think proper to reprobate the measure is becoming. I have
only to say that, as that branch of learning is not in either
of your departments, it was no part of my directions to you
to give an opinion on it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I have, &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>"<span class='sc'>James Pattison</span>."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But not merely on matters of public and official importance
did the masters test the patience of the authorities.
Another letter, also, like the one given above, deposited in
the Royal Artillery Record Office, gives a glimpse at the
private worries over which the Academy Masters brooded—and
which they inflicted on the Lieutenant-Governors. Two
Professors had adjoining quarters in the Warren, adjacent to
the wall bounding the road to Plumstead, and a long way
from the Warren gate. From one of these quarters there
was a communication through the wall to the town—from
the other there was not. The occupant of the latter dwelling
was, in consequence, a miserable and ill-used man; it
was another case of Ahab and Naboth's vineyard—and he
waxed sick as he thought of his hardship.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, appending to his letter an elaborate map of the Warren,
he addressed the Lieutenant-Governor on the subject, begging
either for a right of way through his neighbour's house, or
for a new communication for his own. So quaintly does he
argue his cause, that his words are reproduced for the amusement
of the reader.</p>

<p class='c000'>"For want of such a ready communication with the town
of Woolwich, with regard to my Family, I am subject to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>much inconvenience. For, the way by the gate of the
Warren makes the distance to and from my house so great,
that I can't have the necessary provisions brought to me
as other people have, by Bakers, Butchers, Milkmen, &amp;c.,
without great additional expense, and many not even for
that at any rate. So that I am obliged to send my servants
round about by all that way, on all occasions, to
bring in all things necessary to the Family. This is not
the worst of it; for all kinds of Family necessaries not
being constantly to be bought in the shops in such a place
as Woolwich, many things are brought only occasionally
and cried about the streets, when it is matter of no small
grief that such things as may then be much wanted in the
family can be heard to be cried immediately behind the
house, without a possibility of coming at them, but by
going half a mile round about, when perhaps the servants
can be least spared to go, and when they do go, it is ten to
one they are disappointed by the crier then being gone
quite out of sight and hearing. And besides all this, it is
not always that I can prevail on my good and sober female
servants to be willing so frequently to go through by the
Warren gate, as it is next to an impossibility that such
persons can pass so many soldiers as are generally there
assembled, without sometimes being subject to rencounters
disagreeable to them."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant-Governor, who had not merely official
troubles with the Masters to vex him, but had also to listen to
such harrowing domestic details as those just given, was not
a man to be envied. Even a hundred years later, as the
student comes on this plaintive picture, his imagination
begins to work, and he sees, tearing his hair in his study,
the ill-fated teacher listening to the well-known cry, just
over the Warren walls, which told him that some much-loved
delicacy was there—so near and yet so far.</p>

<p class='c000'>These pages, concerning the early days of the Academy,
suggest the difference between those days and the present.
And in thoroughly analysing that difference, the feeling
grows stronger that two changes are inevitable. Inevitable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>because the principle of justice is involved; but difficult
to bring about speedily, on account of the strength of
Academy traditions. So long ago as 1792, these traditions
were strong enough to defeat a scheme for liberalizing
the scientific officering of the Regiment. Again, in 1855, the
same traditions urged many to oppose a similar change.
And yet, as sure as anything can be, the moment that
the Universities realize that their sons are debarred from
entering the Artillery and the Engineers, by conditions
as to age, and by the long technical Academy curriculum,
from that moment an agitation will commence, which will
sweep all obstructions away. In the early days of the
Academy, the cadets acquired all the education they ever
had, under its roof; not merely technical, but general. But
in these later days, the cadet enters the Academy at a more
advanced age, and with a sound and liberal education. Is
it absolutely necessary that he should spend so long a time
as he does there, on the technical part of his schooling?
Would not the officers of the corps be of a much higher
scientific tone, if they spent a longer time at the University,
and a shorter at the Academy? While admitting the fact
that from the Academy there have come officers who have so
pressed forward with the great army of Science, that they
have become Captains and Generals in its ranks, it would
be flattery to say that the Academy could ever be a rival to
the Universities, although it might certainly be an honoured
and useful helpmate. When it is remembered that an
officer remains for months in a state of professional pupilage
after he obtains his commission, in addition to the time spent
at the Academy, the question instinctively rises: "Is there
not a danger of the technical part of education receiving
more than its fair share?" For although it is easy to add
the technical to the general, it is not easy to reverse the
operation; and in the division of a young man's training life,
which is now made in preparing the officers of the Scientific
Corps, there is a danger lest we may produce, to a certain
extent, scientific soldiers; but not what is also wanted in the
Artillery of these days—scientific and highly educated <em>men</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The other change which must come is in the officering
from one source, of two corps, which are at once sister and
rival. At the time the Academy was founded, it was never
imagined that the small Engineer element then in our
service was to develope itself into the large regiment which
now exists. Nor was it ever believed probable, that one of
the two Scientific Corps would have such pecuniary advantages
over the other, as to tempt many into its ranks who
might otherwise have been indifferent. But both these
events having taken place, the Artilleryman, who sees the
best cadets tempted away every year to the sister corps, may
with justice ask whether he is not paying somewhat dearly
for the relationship. Without any violent divorce, there
must come some friendly separation before many years are
over; and it is more likely to be friendly, if the difficulty is
looked in the face at once, instead of having it urged in
language of harsh misfortune hereafter. The only way of
maintaining the present system with justice would be by
equalizing the pecuniary prospects of officers in both corps;
but this would be more difficult than the obvious remedy
suggested above. At present, the case stands thus:—in
order that Engineer officers may acquire the amount of
Artillery education which will be necessary for them hereafter,
they are educated under the same roof with the future
officers of the Artillery; and the highest and most accomplished
cadets in each class are invited to join the Royal
Engineers. This invitation, being backed by parents who
have a natural eye to their children's future income, is very
generally accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this plain statement of facts, he who runs may read a
grievance to the Royal Artillery, which may develope itself
into a Regimental, if not a national misfortune.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='sc'>A Sterner School.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> same year which saw the foundation of the Royal
Military Academy witnessed the commencement of a
seven years' schooling, which was to leave an indelible mark
on the Regiment. In the West Indies and in Flanders, as
well as in the disturbances at home in 1745, officers and
men learnt lessons, and acquired an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>, to which
they had hitherto been strangers. It is at once pleasing and
amusing to read in the old order-books, framed at Woolwich
during the years between the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle and
the commencement of the Seven Years' War, reminders of
the school of war and discipline represented by the years
between 1741 and 1748. "The same as we wore in Flanders"
was a favourite way for describing a particular dress
for parade. And the word "we" is poetry to the student,
who is searching for signs of an awakening Regimental
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>No history of a Regiment like the Royal Artillery could
be compressed into any reasonable dimensions, if every campaign
in which it was engaged were described in detail. It
must suffice to sketch the campaigns, but to paint in body
colours the Artillery's share. The gradual increase of the
proportion of this arm; the occasions on which it more
particularly distinguished itself; the changes in dress and
equipment; and the officers whose services in the successive
campaigns were most conspicuous; these are the details
which will form the foreground of the Regiment's History.
But even these are so numerous that most careful sifting will
be required to prevent the story from becoming wearisome.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same year, then, which saw the warrant issued for
the foundation of the Royal Military Academy saw also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>despatch to the West Indies of one of the most formidable
expeditions, both in a naval and a military sense, which had
ever left the shores of England. The squadron consisted of
115 vessels, well armed and manned, and the troops were
in number over 12,000. The Royal Artillery was commanded
by Colonel Jonas Watson—a brave and experienced
officer, who did not live to return to England, being killed
at the bombardment of Carthagena,—and was divided into
trains for service on shore, and detachments for service on
board the numerous bomb-vessels which formed part of the
squadron.</p>

<p class='c000'>The troops were to have been commanded by Lord Cathcart,
but unfortunately this officer died of fever, on the
arrival of the expedition at Dominica, and his successor,
General Wentworth, was totally unfit for the duties which
devolved upon him. To this circumstance, and the want of
harmony between him and the naval commander, Admiral
Vernon, the ultimate failure of the expedition was due.
Notwithstanding additional reinforcements from England,
so reduced was this force in two years by disaster and
disease, that not a tenth part returned to England; "and
thus ended in shame, disappointment, and loss, the most
important, most expensive, and the best concerted expedition
that Great Britain was ever engaged in, leaving this
melancholy proof, that if dissension is the misfortune of
a State, it is the ruin of any military undertaking."<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In reading the accounts of this expedition, more especially
of the attack on Carthagena, there is a positive relief in
turning from the passages relating to the quarrels between
the naval and military commanders to those painful but
proud episodes, in which the obedience and bravery of the
troops and seamen were so gloriously manifested; and
although the first service of the Royal Artillery on the
Western side of the Atlantic was neither profitable nor
pleasant, it can be studied with satisfaction, as far as their
performance of their duties and endurance of hardship are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>concerned. As for the blunders which were committed by
the commanders, the blame must lie with them, not with
the executive.</p>

<p class='c000'>To return, however, to Europe. The war of the Austrian
succession had commenced, and England felt obliged to support
Maria Theresa, which she did partly by a grant of
money, and partly by sending an expedition to Flanders
under the aged Earl of Stair. The force employed amounted
to 16,000 men; and the Artillery comprised a considerable
staff, three companies, and thirty guns, 3-pounders.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time the Regiment was distributed as follows:—One
company at Minorca, one in Gibraltar, one at Newfoundland,
two at Woolwich, and three in Flanders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the Artillery was at Ghent in July, 1742, no
military operations were carried on that year, owing to the
backwardness of the Dutch to fulfil their part of the contract;
and the English lay in Flanders, inactive until the
following year.</p>

<p class='c000'>The commanding officer of the Royal Artillery, at first, was
Colonel Thomas Pattison, and the following is a nominal
list of the combatant officers who served under him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>Adjutant <span class='sc'>Joseph Broome</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In November, 1742, Captain James Deal was appointed
Lieutenant-Colonel to the train; Lieutenant Archibald
Macbean was appointed Bridge-master; and Lieutenant
Charles Stranover joined as Lieutenant of Miners.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of non-combatants was very great, and the
total strength of the companies amounted to eighteen non-commissioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>officers, sixty-four gunners, 140 matrosses,
four drummers, and twenty pioneers.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 10th February, 1743, the train left Ghent to join
the Allied Army, which was effected on the 16th May.
King George met the army on the 19th June, and on the
27th was fought the Battle of Dettingen. The Artillery
share in this engagement was small, the chief points of note
in the battle being the gallantry of King George and of the
Duke of Cumberland, and the obstinate bravery of the infantry,
to which—coupled with the blunder of the Duc de
Grammont—the victory was due. The hardships suffered
by the Allies before the battle had been excessive, nor were
they removed by success; so it was considered advisable to
fall back on their supplies instead of following the enemy.
The guns present with the Royal Artillery at the battle
were 3-pounders, twenty-four in number.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following year, 1744, and also in 1745, considerable
augmentations to the officers with the train had been made,
many having become available by the return of the expedition
from the West Indies. Among others, Colonel Jonathan
Lewis was appointed Second Colonel to the train: and Captains
Borgard, Michelson, and Desaguliers, Lieutenants
Charlton, Bennett, and Macbean, and, somewhat later, Major
William Belford, joined it. The last-named officer was
appointed Major to the train, in room of Michelson deceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1744, many of the British troops had been recalled, on
account of an expected invasion of England; and so greatly
did the French Army in Flanders outnumber that of the
Allies, that no resistance could be made to its advance, and
nothing but a diversion on the part of the Austrians, which
made the French King hasten to the defence of his own
kingdom, prevented the complete subjugation of Holland.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1745, the Artillery marched with the army from
Ghent, leaving on the 13th April. The Artillery marched
in rear of the Army in the following order:—First, a sergeant
and six miners, two and two; a tumbril drawn by
three horses with miners' tools; two four-horse waggons,
containing Colonel Lewis's baggage; a front guard of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>twenty-four gunners and matrosses; a sergeant and two
drummers; Lieutenant Pattison marching in front, and
Lieutenant Macbean in rear; the kettledrum; Colonel
Lewis and Captain Michelson on horseback; the flag-gun,
a heavy 6-pounder, on a field-carriage and limber drawn by
nine horses; nine more 6-pounders, drawn as above, but
by seven horses; one spare 6-pounder carriage and limber,
drawn by seven horses; twelve covered tumbrils with stores,
each drawn by three horses; four howitzers with five horses
each; one spare howitzer-carriage and limber, also with five
horses; six covered tumbrils with stores, with three horses
each; ten 3-pounders on "galloping carriages," with four
horses each; a travelling forge cart with three horses;
twenty-three powder tumbrils; and three covered waggons
with officers' tents, baggage, &amp;c., with three horses each.
The remaining officers and men marched on the flanks of the
waggons and guns, a gunner marching by every gun, with
a match. A Regiment of infantry formed the escort, the
grenadier company marching in front, the remainder in rear.
It should have been mentioned that in 1744, an increase to
the armament of the train had been made, comprising ten
heavy 6-pounders and four 8-inch howitzers; and in 1745
another company arrived from Woolwich.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the orders issued by the Duke of Cumberland,
who was in command of the Army at this time, are curious:
"It is strictly ordered by His Royal Highness that none
presume to shoot or hunt, whether officer or private, officers'
servants or huntsmen; this to be a standing order."
Again: "Besides the going out of the Provost, there are
fifty Hussars ordered to patrol in the front and rear of
the camp, and to cut to pieces every man that they may
find beyond the limits of the camp."</p>

<p class='c000'>At Fontenoy, such of the guns as were engaged did good
service, more especially those attached to Ligonier's column,
which preceded its advance, dragged along by ropes, and
doing great execution. Had the Dutch troops fought as
well as the British, Fontenoy would have been a victory for
the Allies, instead of a defeat. The loss of the Royal Artillery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>was small compared with that of the English infantry.
It comprised Lieutenant Bennett, one sergeant, one gunner,
and four matrosses killed; one conductor, two sergeants, one
corporal, six gunners, and thirteen matrosses wounded; two
gunners and four matrosses missing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The guns actually present on the field comprehended ten
6-pounders, twenty-seven 3-pounders, six 1½-pounders,—recently
sent from England—and four 8-inch howitzers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officers present at the Battle of Fontenoy were
Colonel Pattison, Lieut.-Colonel Lewis, Major Belford, Captains
Michelson, Mace, Desaguliers, Flight, Captains-Lieutenant
Ord, Leith, Brome, and Johnson, and Lieutenants
Pattison, Campbell, Cleaveland, Tovey, Stranover, T. Smith,
McLeod, Macbean, Charlton, Strachey, Northall, Maitland,
Hussey, Pike, B. Smith, Bennett (killed), Mason, Durham,
Knox, Farquharson, Worth, and Lindsay. Many of these
had joined the train just before the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The strength of the Allied Army did not exceed 53,000
men; that of the French—under Marshal Saxe, and inspirited
by the presence of the King and the Dauphin—approached
80,000. Of the British troops 4000 were killed and
wounded, besides 2000 Hanoverians. Fontenoy was a defeat,
but hardly one which can be said to have tarnished in the
slightest the British Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke of Cumberland withdrew his forces in good
order. On the march, an order which is extant shows a
novel means of confining prisoners: "The sergeant of
miners is to make a black hole <em>under ground</em>, and the
carpenter to make a door to it with a padlock; always to
be clean straw for the prisoners; and if any sergeant or
corporal suffer anything to go in to them, but bread and
water, they shall be tried for disobedience of orders."</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, the rebellion in Scotland had created such an
alarm that the whole of the Artillery in Flanders, now
amounting to four companies, was recalled to England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prior to their return, however, news had reached the
Allied Army, near Brussels, of the successful result of
the Siege of Louisbourg by the New England troops, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>as a symptom of rejoicing, a review of the Army was ordered
by the Duke of Cumberland, which is mentioned by General
Forbes Macbean in his MS. diary, on account of a circumstance
which can best be described in his own words: "The
Army was drawn up in order of battle, and reviewed by
the Duke: the Park of Artillery was formed in great
order on a fine extensive plain near Vilvorden: the four
companies of Artillery under arms, drawn up, two on the
right, and two on the left of the park: Colonel Pattison,
Lieut.-Colonel Lewis, and Major Belford, posted themselves
on horseback in front of the park, when they saluted
His Royal Highness as he passed, by dropping their
swords. The other officers, carrying fusees, only took off
their hats as he passed them."</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time—in 1745—a company was sent to garrison
Louisbourg, and another was sent to Newfoundland, the Regiment
at this date having been increased to ten companies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interlude of the Scotch rebellion, which involved the
recall of the companies from Flanders, does not require
detailed mention. There was a good deal of what Albert
Borgard would have called useless marching and counter-marching
in England. The Artillery was successful at
Carlisle and Culloden; very unsuccessful at Falkirk. At
Prestonpans, the guns were not served by the Royal Artillery,
but by seamen. At Falkirk, the guns were hard and
fast in a bog, and were not once in action. As soon as the
peasant drivers, who had been engaged with the horses, saw
the Royal Army waver, they promptly fled; and of the eight
guns which had accompanied the King's troops, seven fell
into the hands of the enemy. At Culloden, the victory may
be said to have been won by the Artillery. In the words of
Sir Edward Cust, "the guns were so exceedingly well plied
that they made dreadful lanes through some of the clan
regiments. It was with extreme difficulty that the men
could be kept in their places to stand this murderous fire."
The Artillery was under the command of Colonel Belford.
Only one company of the Regiment was at Culloden, the
remaining five on home service being at Woolwich, whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>in the preceding winter they had furnished detachments
for service in England at Chester, Carlisle, and Newcastle.
The guns employed during the rebellion were 6-pounders,
3-pounders, and howitzers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is with pleasure that one turns from the story of civil
war, always painful, rarely glorious, to Flanders again,
where two companies were ordered immediately after the suppression
of the rebellion. But before doing so, it is impossible
to avoid mentioning a coincidence which is somewhat
singular. As in the Scotch rebellion of 1715, the disastrous
unwieldiness, and the indifferent equipment of the Artillery
trains on the old spasmodic principle, forced upon the
country the idea of a permanent force of Artillery, so in
the Scotch rebellion of 1745, the disaster of Falkirk forced
upon the public attention the folly of a Field Artillery with
no assured mobility. In a contemporary article in the
'Gentleman's Magazine,' quoted by the author of 'England's
Artillerymen,' this feeling found expression; and as
to one Scotch rebellion the Regiment may be said to owe its
birth, so to another it may date the first step in advance
made by that portion of it intended for service in the field.
This coincidence suggests many questions to the student.
Is public opinion necessary to bring about military reform?
And is English public opinion on military questions only
awakened when civil or other war thrusts military blunders
in a very prominent and personal way before public attention?
These questions may be answered partly in the
affirmative, and partly in the negative.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is undoubtedly a consequence of military training, to
produce, in a man's mind, more of an inclination to make the
best of what is, than to suggest change and improvement.
And, further, as change for the better generally implies
expense; and as the heads of military, as of other public
departments, have a particular horror of anything involving
increased outlay, it follows that suggestions in that direction,
made by their own subordinates, are received with scant
favour, and the would-be reformers are deterred in every
way from pursuing their inclinations. But the public owes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>no allegiance to its officials; and the wildest schemes from
an outsider receive an attention denied to the most practical
suggestions from those in the employment of a department.
Although, therefore, the public is often the father of military
advances, it must not hastily be assumed that this is owing
to a want of originality in military men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, although civil war in England demonstrated military
defects in a very special way, it must not be assumed
either that these defects had not been apparent to soldiers
before, or that so strong a measure as civil war was necessary
to enlist public opinion. Apart from the cause above mentioned,
which would deter an officer from recommending
change, it must not be inferred that the same delicacy was
shown to the peasantry of other countries, where transport
was required for the Artillery, as to those who were called
upon in England for assistance. Martial law, which would
have been rarely, if ever, enforced upon English peasantry
by English commanders, was freely exercised abroad; and,
with this exercise, the want of mobility was not so frequently
allowed to appear. And with regard to the necessity of an
actual, bitter home-experience being required to awaken
public opinion, the recent Franco-German war proves the
contrary. The reports of the value of Artillery in that
campaign were sufficient, without actual and personal observation,
to awaken in the public mind a strong and unanimous
resolution to perfect that arm in England, such as no government
could have dared to thwart. When backed by public
opinion in England, a Government will gladly make changes
involving expense, and in fact, to refuse to do so would be
folly; but when that public opinion, even if foolish and
ignorant, is against change or expense, or even indifferent on
the subject, the military reformer within the ranks of the
Army may as well beat the air as urge his suggestions. All
these considerations have to be borne in mind when studying
the history of Army reforms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two companies which went to Flanders in 1746, were
under the command of Colonel Lewis; Captain Borgard,
Michelson acting as Major; Lieutenant Brome as Adjutant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>and Lieutenant Stranover as Quartermaster. The number of
subaltern officers with the companies seems excessive, being
no less than ten, besides three Captain-Lieutenants; but a
means of employing them was adopted this year, by distributing
the fourteen 3-pounder guns, which were with the
companies, among the seven battalions; two to each battalion
under a Lieutenant. This arrangement was ordered on the
20th July, 1746; but it is soothing to the student to find on
the 23rd of the following month this pernicious custom suspended,
and the battalion guns ordered to join the reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1747, there were five companies in Flanders, three
having been added to the Regiment; and the following was
the armament in their charge: six heavy 12-pounders; six
heavy 9-pounders; fourteen heavy and twelve light 6-pounders:
fourteen heavy 3-pounders: two 8-inch howitzers;
and six Royal mortars.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1748, in addition to the above, thirty-two light 6-pounders
were sent for use with the battalions.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the battle of Roncoux, the want of Artillery was sorely
felt by the British, the more so, as the enemy was in this
arm particularly strong; and doubtless this led to the great
increase made in 1747, both in men and guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arrival of Colonel Belford to command the Artillery
in the winter of 1746, and during the rest of the campaign,
produced a marked and beneficial effect. Colonel Pattison
and Major Lewis were allowed to retire on full-pay, in
January 1748, on account of old age and infirmities: and
their younger successors devoted themselves to giving a
military appearance to the companies under their command.
In this they were greatly assisted, not merely by the improved
and better educated class of officers, now joining from
the Academy; but also by an accidental circumstance which
swelled the ranks with many well-trained soldiers. It is
mentioned as follows by old General Macbean: "About this
time, three Regiments of Cavalry being reduced to Dragoons,
and the troopers having it in their option to remain
as Dragoons or be discharged, many of them chose the
latter; and above two hundred of them enlisted into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Artillery. From this period, the Regiment improved
much in appearance, and in the size of the men, neither of
which had been hitherto much attended to; but receiving
at once so many tall men in the corps may be said to have
given rise to the change that has taken place in regard to
the height, strength, and figure of the men which now
compose it." Among other means of training and disciplining
the men under his command during the tedious
months when the Army was in winter quarters, Colonel
Belford devoted much time to practising them in the use of
small-arms, and in infantry manœuvres, never yet practised
in the Regiment. So successful was he, that the Duke of
Cumberland reviewed the companies; on which occasion the
gunners of the companies, with their field staffs, formed upon
the right as a company of grenadiers; and the matrosses,
with their muskets, as a battalion. There are not wanting,
in the nineteenth century, men who wish that Colonel
Belford's zeal had taken some other direction; who think the
use of Artillerymen, even on field-days, as infantry, is a misuse;
and who would remove the carbines from the Garrison
Artillery, in order that more time might be allowed for their
own special and varied drills. There are even scoffers, who
say that the presence of a body of men in the garrison under
his command, armed and equipped like infantry, is more
than a General Officer can bear; that he is never at rest
until he sees this body swelling his Brigade by another
battalion; and that he inspects it in infantry details more
minutely than in those of its own special arm. Whatever
ground there may be for these complaints, there can be no
doubt that Colonel Belford was innocent of any desire to
divert his men from their own work: and merely availed
himself of this, as of other means of disciplining and training
them into habits of smartness and obedience. And among
other things which he borrowed from the infantry, besides
their drill, was that of an Officer's Regimental Guard over
the Artillery Park, in addition to the guard furnished by the
Line Regiments, a more important item than it would at
first sight appear to be.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Two Courts-martial, one upon an officer, and one upon a
gunner, are mentioned here, as probably interesting to the
reader. Lieutenant McCulloch, having been tried and found
guilty by a General Court-martial, of disobedience to Colonel
Belford's orders, was suspended for the space of three months,
and ordered to make the following submission: "I am very
sorry I am guilty of a neglect of my duty, and I do particularly
ask Colonel Belford's pardon, and will, for the
future, avoid being guilty of a thing of the like nature."
Having complied with the submission, and Colonel Belford
having requested that the remaining part of the sentence
might be remitted, the Duke of Cumberland, being highly
pleased with the conduct of the Artillery at the recent battle
of Val, was pleased to accede to the request.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gunner, who was tried, had been guilty of insubordination
towards a sergeant, and being formally convicted
by a Regimental Court-martial, was sentenced to be "reduced
in pay and duty for one month to matross, ride the
gun, ask the sergeant's pardon at the head of the Regiment,
and that the difference of his pay be employed for
the use of the sick."</p>

<p class='c000'>In reading the accounts of this war between the Allies
and the French, one feels how just was the remark of
Louis XV. after Val, that the "British not only paid all,
but fought all." On them fell all the brunt of every engagement,
and the discussion and misunderstanding which so
often prevailed among the Allied commanders had no effect
upon the bravery of the British troops. At Val, the Artillery
had thirty men killed, Major Michelson, Lieutenants
McLeod, Farrington, Dexter, Stephens, Pedley, and nineteen
men wounded; and twenty-five taken prisoners. They received
the special thanks of the Duke for their conduct
during this obstinate and bloody engagement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next thing that strikes one is the cool and able
generalship of Marshal Saxe. He had superior numbers
under his command; nor did he suffer from divided counsels,
but these advantages do not conceal his military talent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, to the student's mind, the absurdly luxurious way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of making war then prevalent suggests itself, if the term
can be applied to any contest where loss of life was so great.
It was, indeed, a game at which the leaders played; and in
the quiet of their systematic winter-quarters they devised
and matured new moves for the coming season. How
changed is modern warfare! What a different system is to
be read in the stories of the trenches before Sebastopol, or
the winter encampment of the Germans round Paris!</p>

<p class='c000'>The war gradually filtered itself away into the peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle. After Val came the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom,
where fourteen men of the Royal Artillery were
killed; then came winter quarters at Breda; then came preparations
for a new campaign in 1748; although peace was
in every one's mind, and the plenipotentiaries to conclude it
had already met; then came the siege of Maestricht, with its
Quixotic ending; and at last came peace itself. A peace
which brought profit neither to England nor to France;
which could not obliterate the long list on the rolls of
each nation which war had entered in the books of death;
which, if possible, only made the folly of the contest more
apparent; and which, while it ceased the actual roll of
cannon, and crossing of bayonets, did not stop the pulsation
of hatred in each nation's breast, which was to throb with
increasing vigour, until a new and more bitter war should
gratify the unsmothered longings of each. A peace which—with
the solitary exception of Prussia—seemed to do good,
or bring rest to none but unhappy Flanders, the battleground
of Europe, the victim in every international contest.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a peace, also, which closed for a time that sterner
school of discipline in which the Royal Artillery had now
for years been studying; in which there had been officers
such as Macbean, Desaguliers, Phillips, and Pattison, learning
lessons, which were to bear fruit in yet grimmer warfare,
both in Europe and America; and on whose black-boards—blank
in this respect, when the war commenced—there had
now been indelibly inscribed the words, that "an Army
without Artillery is no Army at all!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Before closing this chapter, there are one or two points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>connected with the Artillery in the field, which deserve
mention. First; the amount of ammunition which was carried
in the field with each gun was as follows:—100 round-shot,
and 30 rounds of grape; with the exception of the long
6-pounder guns, which carried 80 round-shot, and 40 grape.
Second; the stores and ammunition were issued direct by the
Commissaries to the officers commanding Brigades of guns,
<em>i.e.</em> Batteries—on requisition—who had, however, to make
their own cartridges, and fix the wooden bottoms to the
round-shot and grape, after receipt. The wooden bottoms
were made by the artificer, called the turner; and were
fastened by the tinman. Another of the tinman's duties was
the manufacture of the tubes—and of boxes to contain them.
Third; luxurious in one sense, as the war was, it had its
hardships, as the following extract will show:—August 27th,
1746.—"Arrived at camp after a most difficult march, the
Artillery constantly moving for four days and three nights
without encamping—nearly starved; through woods, over
mountainous country, with the bottoms full of rapid little
rivers and deep marshes. Almost all the horses lost their
shoes, and men and horses nearly starved. 3rd September.—Marched
from the camp at 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and crossed the Maise,
170 yards broad, over the pontoon bridges, near Maistricht.
The bridges were commenced laying at one o'clock in the
morning, and were completed by seven, when the heads of
the column made their appearance. The French army
was in order of battle on the heights of Hautain, opposite
to Visel, where he supposed we were to pass, with a design
to fall upon us when we were partly crossed the river.
5th September.—The enemy attacked our light troops
posted opposite to Visel, on the Maise, and handled them
very roughly; those that were not killed, being forced
into the river, where they were drowned." Lastly, it is to
be noted that, as in all our later wars before they have lasted
any time, the ranks were thinned by disease and death, and
there was a difficulty in replenishing them, even with <em>recruits</em>.
It is to be hoped that the system of reserves recently organized
in the English Army will in future mitigate this evil.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>On the return of the Army to England in 1748, three
companies of Artillery were reduced; the officers being
gradually brought in, as vacancies occurred. Among other
customs brought by the companies from Flanders was that
of employing fifers as well as drummers: "the first fifers
in the British Army having been established in the Royal
Regiment of Artillery at the end of this war, being taught
by John Ulrich, a Hanoverian fifer, brought from Flanders
by Colonel Belford, when the Allied Army separated."<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>So much for the school of discipline in Europe. But
there had been a class-room opened in the East, to which
the Regiment sent some pupils. Admiral Boscawen had been
ordered to the East Indies, in command of a mixed naval and
military force, including a company of the Royal Artillery,
under Major Goodyear. The force of the enemy, and the
strength of his defences, had been underrated; and it cannot
be said that the expedition was very successful. The ordnance
which accompanied the Artillery consisted of twelve
6-pounders, six 3-pounders, two 10-inch, three 8-inch, fifteen
5½ inch, and twenty-five 4⅖-inch mortars, all of brass. It
was at the siege of Pondicherry that these guns were used,
a siege which lasted from the 11th of August to the 6th of
October, 1748, when Admiral Boscawen was compelled to
raise it after a loss of over 1000 men. The Royal Artillery
lost, out of a total of 148 of all ranks, no less than forty-three,
including Major Goodyear, who fell, mortally wounded,
during the siege, his leg being carried away by a round-shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>A stop was put to the hostilities by the declaration of
peace, but the presence of Admiral Boscawen enabled him
to ratify, in a prompt manner, that part of the treaty which
restored Madras to the English. Many men of Major Goodyear's
company were allowed, in 1749, to volunteer for the
East India Company's service.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this expedition has an interest to the Artilleryman
beyond the military operations. Before sailing, Admiral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Boscawen asserted his intention, in spite of Major Goodyear's
remonstrances, of filling up, as Commander-in-Chief, any
vacancies which might occur in the company of Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Board of Ordnance was appealed to, and most warmly
protested against such an interference with its prerogative,—declaring
that none of the appointments made by the
Admiral would be recognized by the present or any succeeding
Master-General. Doubtless, the Board was right;
and Admiral Boscawen, being anxious to retain the favour
of all under his command, let the matter drop. With a
seniority corps, essentially detached when on service, it was
absolutely necessary that promotion should be general, not
local. At the same time, the restraint of the Board was
irksome—not the less so because just; and the feeling could
never be agreeable to a commander, that serving under him
were those who owed a special allegiance to another. As
time went on, and the military department of the Ordnance
increased, this irritation would become more general, and
the points of difference between Generals and the Board
would multiply.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wisdom of the change which put Generals and the
Ordnance Corps under one head might have been proved by
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, as it has been by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à posteriori</span></i> reasoning; and this
trifling episode between Admiral Boscawen and the Board is
interesting, as showing that, thirty years after the Regiment
had been called into existence, the Dual Government of the
Artillery was already producing natural consequences. But
it is also interesting, as manifesting the affection which the
Board already evinced for the child they had begotten—an
interest sometimes too paternal, but never unlovely.</p>

<p class='c000'>An excellent letter from the principal officers of the
Ordnance is extant, urging the claims to Army Rank of
the officers of the Artillery, which had been again questioned
by some belonging to the other arms of the service. The
difficulty was, in a very few years, settled by the King,
in place of the Master-General, signing the commissions of
Artillery officers; but this letter from the Board is interesting,
as pleading, on grounds of justice and in language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>far warmer than could have been expected, the claims of the
corps which they had created. The letter bears date 24th
February, 1744, and, after quoting the decision in favour of
Artillery officers arrived at by the King in 1724, and confirmed
in 1735, and mentioning two Courts-martial held in
1737 and 1742, at which officers of Artillery sat with those of
the other arms, according to date of Commission, goes on to
say that, notwithstanding these facts, there are not wanting
those who deny any military status to Artillery officers in
the field. The writers then state a case, to show the
absurdity of the view objected to:—"If a Captain of Artillery,
with a number of guns and Artillery people, should
happen to be escorted by a Lieutenant of a Regiment on
Foot, with a number of men belonging thereto, the Captain
(according to the sentiments of those with whom we differ)
must take his orders from the Lieutenant, which he would,
with reason, think a great hardship; for the Lieutenant
would not obey one whom he deems to be no more than a
titular Captain, and who, he is taught to believe, has no
rank in the Army. And if the said Lieutenant should be
killed, and the command devolve to the eldest sergeant,
according to the notion before mentioned, the Captain of
Artillery must take his orders from the said Sergeant of
Foot,—the consequence of which is so obvious, that we
need not enlarge upon it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But further, my Lord, should this opinion prevail, it
would be a total discouragement to the officers of Artillery,
as well as highly prejudicial to His Majesty's Service."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The ordinary duty and discipline of the officers and
private men of the Artillery is, in every respect, the same
with that of every other Regiment of the Army. The
qualifications of Artillery officers are not acquired by
practice only, but are the result of long study and application.
They must be proficients in several sciences, and
Masters of several arts, which is not required from other
officers. They are subjected to the Articles of War, and
all the penalties of the Act for Mutiny and Desertion,
and are equally a part of His Majesty's Forces with any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>other Regiment of the Army. The service of the Artillery
is generally understood to be more dangerous and severe
than any other; and although they are an essential part
of one and the same Army, yet if they bear no rank in it,
but at Courts-martial only, they are in a worse situation
and under greater difficulties and discouragements than
any part of the Army; for, let their service have been ever
so long,—their conduct and bravery ever so conspicuous
and meritorious,—they can only rise gradually and slowly
in their own little corps, if they have no rank in the Army,
and can never be promoted in any other, which is the
usual and almost only reward of distinguished merit in
other officers."</p>

<p class='c000'>While sympathizing with the spirit which animated the
writers of the above, one may differ as to the nature of the
reward they sought for meritorious officers of Artillery, in
promotion into the other arms. For more than forty years
after this letter was written this reward was one which was
coveted by the senior officers of the corps for the younger
members. Doubtless, the intention was to obtain a promotion
for them which could not be found in the stagnation of a
seniority corps. But, to the modern Artilleryman, the promotion
which involved separation from the Regiment for
whose duties he had been specially trained would be but a
doubtful reward.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='sc'>Woolwich in the Olden Time.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Life</span> in the Barracks in the Warren, where the Artillery
at Woolwich were stationed, with the exception of one
company, which was detached at Greenwich whenever the
Warren was overcrowded, can be gathered from the Standing
Orders which survive in the old MS. order-books in the
Royal Artillery Regimental Library and Royal Artillery
Record Office. A few of these orders, extracted from the
books whose contents extend over the period between 1741
and 1757, cannot fail to be interesting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The establishment of each company at the commencement
of that period was as follows:—One Captain, one Captain-Lieutenant,
one First Lieutenant, one Second Lieutenant,
three Lieutenant Fireworkers, three Sergeants, three Corporals,
eight Bombardiers, twenty Gunners, sixty-four
Matrosses, and two Drummers—in all, one hundred and
seven.</p>

<p class='c000'>The uniform dress of the officers was a plain blue coat,
lined with scarlet, a large scarlet Argyle cuff, double-breasted,
and with yellow buttons to the bottom of the
skirts; scarlet waistcoat and breeches—the waistcoat
trimmed with broad gold lace,—and a gold-laced hat. The
Sergeants' coats were trimmed, the lappels, cuffs, and
pockets with a broad single gold lace; the Corporals' and
Bombardiers' with a narrow single gold lace; the Gunners'
and Matrosses', plain-blue coats; all the non-commissioned
officers and men having scarlet half-lappels, scarlet cuffs, and
slashed sleeves with five buttons, and blue waistcoats and
breeches; the Sergeants' hats trimmed with a broad and the
other non-commissioned officers' and men's with a narrow
gold lace. White spatterdashes were then worn. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Regimental clothing was delivered to the non-commissioned
officers and men once a year, with the exception of the
Regimental coats, which they only received every second
year; receiving in the intermediate year a coarse blue loose
surtout, which served for laboratory work, cooking, fatigue
duties, &amp;c. The arms of the officers were fusees without
bayonets, and not uniform. The sergeants, corporals, and
bombardiers were armed with halberds and long brass-hilted
swords; "the gunners carried field-staffs about two feet
longer than a halberd, with two lintstock cocks branching
out at the head, and a spear projecting between and beyond
them (great care was paid to keeping these very
bright); a buff belt over the left shoulder, slinging a large
powder-horn, mounted with brass over the right pocket;
and the same long brass-hilted swords as worn by the non-commissioned
officers. The matrosses had only common
muskets and bayonets, with cartouche-boxes."<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The variations in the dress of the Regiment which subsequently
were made will be noted in their proper places.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few of the orders issued by General Borgard are given
to show the interior economy of the Regiment in 1743 and
subsequent years:</p>

<p class='c000'>March 13, 1743. "That the corporals and bombardiers
do not drink with any of the private men."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 29, 1743. "That if any non-commissioned officer
or gunner make himself unfit for the King's duty, either
by drinking, whoring, or any other bad practice, he will
send them to the Hospital at London for cure, and discharge
them out of the Regiment."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 30, 1744. "That no man go out a-shooting, on
any account whatever."</p>

<p class='c000'>August 15, 1744. "The Captains to advertise all their
deserters in the newspapers."</p>

<p class='c000'>October 29, 1744. "That none of the people go three
miles out of quarters without a passport, in writing, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the Captain or officer commanding the Company to which
they belong."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 15, 1745. "That neither non-commissioned
officers, cadets, nor private men go a-shooting, either in
the Warren or Country, without leave of their officer who
commands the company to which they belong."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 18, 1746. "That none of the non-commissioned
officers strike any of the men, on any pretence whatsoever;
but in case they are guilty of any misbehaviour,
confine them prisoners and report them to the commanding
officer. That the Sergeants, Corporals, and Bombardiers
enrol in duty all alike."</p>

<p class='c000'>July 22, 1746. "That the Sergeants and Corporals go
round all the Public-houses in Town, and acquaint them
that it is the General's orders that they trust none of the
Train people on any account whatever."</p>

<p class='c000'>October 20, 1746. "That none of the men carry their
victuals from the Baker's or any other weight on their
Regimental Hats. That the Orderly Sergeants and Corporals
make these orders known to the same."</p>

<p class='c000'>November 21, 1746. "That the Captains have all their
men provided with a knapsack, two pair of shoes, three
pair of stockings, and three shirts and stocks each."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 2, 1747. "That none of the men be suffered to go
to work in their Regimental coats, but either in frocks or
surtouts."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 16, 1747. "The men who are taken sick and sent
to the Infirmary are to be paid only 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per week,
which money is to be paid the nurse for subsistence;
The remainder of their pay to be kept until they are
recovered."</p>

<p class='c000'>June 16, 1747. "That none of the officers turn any of
their horses to graze in the Warren."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 8, 1749. "That none of the Lieutenants go to
London, stay all night out of quarters, change his guard,
or any other duty without the General's or Commanding
Officer's leave; that they first apply to their Captain or
Commanding Officer of the Company to which they belong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>for his consent to be absent, which if obtained, they may
then apply to the commanding officer, and not before;
that if any officer change his guard or other duty without
leave, or does not attend the Parade exactly at the Hour of
Mounting, or the proper time when visiting the Barracks,
or any other duty is to be done, that the Adjutant report
the same directly to the Commanding Officer in quarters."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 27, 1749. "The Roll to be called in the Barracks
at nine o'clock at night, in presence of the Officer
on Guard, who is to have a Report made to him in writing
of those absent. Immediately after the Roll is called the
Orderly Corporals are to go into Town, and each go round
their men's quarters (those in private lodgings as well as
those billeted in Public-houses), and make a report to the
Officer of the Guard of those who are absent. The Orderly
men are then to go to their Rooms, and the Sergeant of
the Guard to lock both Barrack doors, and bring the
keys to his officer, who is to send the Sergeant to open
the doors at <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Reveillé</span></i> beating in the morning. The officer
shall confine any of those men who are found absent if
they come in during his Guard, and report them to the
Commanding Officer at his being relieved. But, in case
they do not come in during his Guard, he is to leave their
names with the relieving officer. If the orderly men find
any men absent from quarters over night, they are to go
early next morning to see if they are come home, and, if
they find they are, to bring them to the Guard in order
to be examined by the officer and give reasons for being
absent the night before. If the orderly men, in going
round, find any man drinking in Public-houses where they
are not quartered, they are to order them home, which if
they refuse to comply with, are to bring them directly to
the Guard, and confine them for disobeying orders."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 1, 1749. "The Orderly Corporals are to report to
their respective Captains all non-commissioned officers and
private men who do not parade for church, in order to
their being stopped a day's pay, according to the Articles
of War; and if any man is seen to quit his rank after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>marching from the parade, and does not go to Church, he
shall be punished the same as if he had not paraded, of
which the non-commissioned officers who go to Church are
to report at their return to the Orderly Corporals, and
they to the Captains."</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>There was immense excitement in Woolwich in the spring
of 1749. A great firework, made at Woolwich, was to be
exhibited in the Green Park, and the Regiment, for the first
time, was to be reviewed by the King. The Order-books
bristle with threats and admonitions, and some of them
reveal a power in the Commanding Officer of which he has
long been deprived.</p>

<p class='c000'>April 16th, 1749. "The officers and men to be under
arms to-morrow both morning and afternoon. The officers
to endeavour as much as possible to perfect themselves,
both in taking posts and saluting. The captains to see
that their companies march strong, and in as good order as
possible, on Tuesday morning at seven o'clock, in order to
their being reviewed on Wednesday by the King. Every
man to parade with his arms and accoutrements as clean
as hands can make them; and in case any of their clothes
want mending or buttons, the person so offending shall
be severely punished. And the first man that is seen
drunk, or the least in liquor, he shall be immediately
brought to y<sup>e</sup> halberts, and there receive 300 lashes, and
afterwards be drummed out of the Regiment with a rope
about his neck. The guard to mount to-morrow in black
spatterdashes, and the officers in boots."</p>

<p class='c000'>After order. "That all the cadets who desire to see the
fireworks be under arms at five o'clock in black spatterdashes,
and their officers in boots, in order to march by
Lambeth to the Green Park. They are to take white
spatterdashes in their pockets to appear in."</p>

<p class='c000'>The discipline among the cadets may be comprehended
from the following order:—</p>

<p class='c000'>October 10, 1840. "Complaints having been made to
the Board that the following persons belonging to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Company of Gentlemen Cadets in the Royal Regiment of
Artillery have been very negligent of their duty, viz.,
Francis Volloton, Archibald Douglas, &amp;c. &amp;c. And that
Francis Volloton has been absent above twelve months,
and not so much as attended the muster, and has otherwise
misbehaved himself. It is the Board's orders that
the said Francis Volloton be broke, and the rest suspended
from their pay till they show cause to the contrary."</p>

<p class='c000'>A previous order to that just quoted shows that boyishness
was not confined to the Cadets. An order, twice issued,
appeared on</p>

<p class='c000'>July 23, 1749. "That none of the men play at long
bullet on Plumstead Road, of which they are all to be
acquainted."</p>

<p class='c000'>August 26, 1749. "When any of the men die or desert,
the Captain of the company is to put down the day in the
muster-roll against his name, and the money to be left in
the agent's hands from the day such men died or deserted
for recruiting others in their room."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 14, 1750. "The Captains or commanding officers
of companies are to observe that henceforward no man is
to be enlisted under five feet nine inches without shoes."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 30, 1750. "The Sergeant of the Guard is not to
suffer any non-commissioned officer or private man to go
out of the Warren gate unless they are dressed clean, their
hair combed and tied up, with clean stockings, and shoes
well blacked, and in every other respect like soldiers.
The cooks are excepted during their cooking hours, but
not otherwise."</p>

<p class='c000'>May 9, 1750. "No subaltern officer is for the future to
have a servant out of any of the companies."</p>

<p class='c000'>July 17, 1750. "The commanding officers of companies
are ordered by the general to provide proper wigs for such
of their respective men that do not wear their hair, as
soon as possible."</p>

<p class='c000'>July 25, 1750. "Each company is to be divided into
three squads. The officers and non-commissioned officers
to be appointed to them to be answerable that the arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>accoutrements, &amp;c., are kept in constant good order, and
that the men always appear clean."</p>

<p class='c000'>July 25, 1750. "Joseph Spiers, gunner in Captain Desagulier's
company, is by sentence of a Court-martial broke
to a matross, and to receive 100 lashes; but General Borgard
has been pleased to forgive him the punishment."</p>

<p class='c000'>A General Court-martial was ordered to assemble <em>at the
Academy</em> to try a matross for desertion. The Court, which
assembled at 10 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the 20th October, 1750, was composed
of Lieutenant-Colonel Belford as President, with nine
captains and three lieutenants as members.</p>

<p class='c000'>November 3, 1750. "Sergeant Campbell, in Captain
Pattison's company, is by sentence of a Regimental Court-martial
reduced to a Bombardier for one month, from the
date hereof, and the difference of his pay to be stopped."</p>

<p class='c000'>The death of General Borgard took place in 1751, and he
was succeeded by Colonel Belford. This officer was most
energetic in drilling officers and men, and in compelling
them to attend Academy and all other instructions. Even
such an opportunity as the daily relief of the Warren guard
was turned to account by him; and the old and new guards
were formed into a company for an hour's drill, under the
senior officer present, at guard mounting. From one order
issued by him, it would seem as if the authority of the
captains required support, being somewhat weakened perhaps,
as is often the case, by the oversight and interference
in small matters by the colonel; for we find it was necessary
on March 2, 1751, to order "That when any of the
Captains review their companies either with or without
arms, all the officers belonging to them were to be present."</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Belford's weakness for the carbine is apparent in
many of his orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>April 1, 1751. "All the officers' servants who are awkward
at the exercise of the small arms to be out every afternoon
with the awkward men, and the rest of them to attend the
exercise of the gun."</p>

<p class='c000'>A most important official must have been expected in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Warren on the 5th August, 1751, for we find orders issued
on the previous evening, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Regiment to be under arms to-morrow morning at
nine o'clock. The commanding officers are to see that
their respective men are extremely well-powdered, and as
clean as possible in every respect. The guard to consist
to-morrow of one Captain, two Lieutenants, two Sergeants,
four Corporals, and forty men. The forty men are to consist
of ten of the handsomest fellows in each of the companies.
The Sergeant of the Guard to-morrow morning is not to
suffer anybody into the Warren but such as shall appear
like gentlemen and ladies."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 7, 1752. "For the future when any man is
discharged he is not to take his coat or hat with him,
unless he has worn them a year."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 6, 1752. "The officer of the Guard is for the future
to send a patrol through the town at any time he pleases
between half an hour after ten at night and one in the
morning, with orders to the Corporal to bring prisoners all
the men of the Regiment he finds straggling in the streets.
The Corporal is likewise to inspect all the alehouses, where
there are lights, and if there are any of the men drinking
in such houses, they are also to be brought to the Guard;
but the patrol is by no means to interfere with riot or
anything that may happen among the town-people."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 20, 1752. "When any man is to be whipped by
sentence of a court-martial, the Surgeon, or his Mate, is to
attend the punishment."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 6, 1753. "The officers are to appear in Regimental
hats under arms, and no others."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 19, 1753. "The officers appointed to inspect
the several squads are to review them once every week
for the future; to see that every man has four good shirts,
four stocks, four pair of stockings, two pair of white, and
one pair of black spatterdashes, two pair of shoes, &amp;c.;
and that their arms, accoutrements, and clothes are in the
best order. What may be required to complete the above
number is to be reported to the commanding officer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>the Captains. The officers are likewise to see that the
men of their squads always appear clean and well-dressed
like soldiers; and acquaint their Captains when they intend
to review them."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 20, 1753. "The Captains are to give directions
to their Paymasters to see that the initial letters of every
man's name are marked with ink in the collar of their shirts."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 5, 1753. "The Captains or commanding officers of
companies are not to give leave of absence to any of their
recruits or awkward men."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 29, 1753. "It is Colonel Belford's positive orders
that for the future, either the Surgeon or his Mate always
remain in quarters."</p>

<p class='c000'>May 23, 1753. "No non-commissioned officer or private
man to appear with ruffles under arms."</p>

<p class='c000'>June 15, 1753. "No man to be enlisted for the future
who is not full five feet nine inches without shoes, straight
limbed, of a good appearance, and not exceeding twenty-five
years of age."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 2, 1754. "No officer to appear under arms in a
bob-wig for the future."</p>

<p class='c000'>October 19, 1754. "When any of the men are furnished
with necessaries, their Paymasters are immediately to give
them account in writing of what each article cost."</p>

<p class='c000'>October 28, 1754. No Cadet is for the future to take
any leave of absence but by Sir John Ligonier, or the
commanding officer in quarters."</p>

<p class='c000'>November 8, 1754. "In order that the sick may have
proper airing, one of the orderly Corporals is every day,
at such an hour as the Surgeon shall think proper, to
collect all those in the Infirmary who may require airing,
and when he has sufficiently walked them about the
Warren, he is to see them safe into the Infirmary. If any
sick man is seen out at any other time, they will be
punished for disobedience of orders."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 17, 1755. "All officers promoted, and those who
are newly appointed, are to wait on Colonel Belford with
their commissions as soon as they receive them."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>July 20, 1755. "If any orderly or other non-commissioned
officer shall excuse any man from duty or exercise
without his officer's leave, he will be immediately broke."</p>

<p class='c000'>August 1, 1755. "As there are bomb and fire-ship stores
preparing in the Laboratory, the officers who are not acquainted
with that service, and not on any other duty, will
please to attend, when convenient, for their improvement."</p>

<p class='c000'>August 8, 1755. "It is ordered that no non-commissioned
officer or soldier shall for the future go out of the
Warren gate without their hats being well cocked, their
hair well-combed, tied, and dressed in a regimental manner,
their shoes well blacked, and clean in every respect....
And it is recommended to the officers and non-commissioned
officers, that if they at any time should meet any of
the men drunk, or not dressed as before mentioned, to send
them to the Guard to be punished."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 13, 1756. "The Captains are forthwith to
provide their respective companies with a knapsack and
haversack each man."</p>

<p class='c000'>February 16, 1756. "For the future, when any Recruits
are brought to the Regiment, they are immediately to be
taken to the Colonel or commanding officer for his approbation;
as soon as he has approved of them, they are
directly to be drawn for, and the officers to whose lot they
may fall are forthwith to provide them with good quarters,
and they are next day to be put to the exercise."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 16, 1756. "The Captains are to attend parade
morning and afternoon, and to see that the men of their
respective companies are dressed like soldiers before they
are detached to the guns."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 30, 1756. "It is recommended to the officers to
confine every man they see dirty out of the Warren, or
with a bad cocked hat."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 31, 1756. "The officers are desired not to appear
on the parade for the future with hats otherwised cocked
than in the Cumberland manner."</p>

<p class='c000'>April 2, 1756. "It is the Duke of Marlborough's orders
that Colonel Belford writes to Captain Pattison to acquaint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>General Bland that it is His Royal Highness's commands
that the Artillery take the right of all Foot on all parades,
and likewise of dragoons when dismounted."</p>

<p class='c000'>May 1, 1756. "It is Colonel Belford's orders that no
non-commissioned officer, or private man, is to wear ruffles
on their wrists when under arms, or any duty whatsoever
for the future."</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time, a camp was ordered to be formed at
Byfleet, where the Master-General of the Ordnance was
present, and as many of the Royal Artillery as could be
spared. Most of the Ordnance for the camp went from the
Tower, and the following disposition of the Artillery on
the march from London to Byfleet may be found interesting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Giving a total of 29 officers, 61 non-commissioned officers,
57 gunners, 330 matrosses, 80 miners, 7 fifers, and 12
drummers.</p>

<p class='c000'>This train of Artillery left the Tower in July, and remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in Byfleet until October, practising experiments in
mining, and the usual exercises of Ordnance, under the
immediate eye of the Master-General himself, the Duke of
Marlborough, who marched at the head of the train, and
encamped with it. An interesting allusion to a custom long
extinct appears in the orders relative to the camp. We find
certain artificers detailed for the flag-gun and the flag-waggon.
The former was always one of the heaviest in the
field; and the custom is mentioned in 1722, 1747, and in
India in 1750. Colonel Miller, in alluding to this custom
in his valuable pamphlet, expresses his opinion that the
flag on the gun corresponded to the Queen's colour, and that
on the waggon to the Regimental colour, the latter probably
bearing the Ordnance Arms. The guns had been divided
into Brigades, corresponding to the modern Batteries.
Four 24-pounders, five 12-pounders, five 6-pounders, and
six 3-pounders, respectively, constituted a Brigade. The
howitzers were in Brigades of three. The discipline insisted
upon was very strict. Lights were not allowed even in the
sutler's tents after ten o'clock; no man was allowed to go
more than a mile from camp without a pass; officers were
not allowed to appear in plain clothes upon any occasion;
strong guards were mounted in every direction, with most
voluminous orders to obey,—orders which seem occasionally
unreasonable. The Captain of the Guard had to see the
evening gun fired, and was made "answerable for any accident
that might happen"—a somewhat heavy responsibility,
as accidents are not always within the sphere of
control, where the executive officer's duties are placed.
Whenever the weather was fine, all the powder was carefully
aired, and all articles of equipment requiring repair were
laid out for inspection. The powers of the commanding
officers of companies in granting indulgences to their men
were curtailed. No artificer was allowed to be employed at
any time on any service but His Majesty's, without the leave
of the Duke of Marlborough himself, or the commandant in
the camp; and should any officer excuse a man from parade
he was to be put in arrest for disobedience of orders.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Colonel Belford revelled in the discipline of the camp. It
brought back to his mind the old days in Flanders when he
worked so hard to imbue his men with a strict military
spirit, and, with the Master-General by his side, he felt
renewed vigour and keenness. The Regiment was attracting
greater attention every year; augmentations were continuous.
The year before the Byfleet camp was formed, six companies
had been added: this year there were three more; and in
1757, four additional companies were to be raised. The
King had reviewed the Regiment, and the Duke of Cumberland
came to Woolwich every year to inspect and encourage.
Who can tell whether the new organization of 1757, which
divided the Regiment into Battalions and accelerated the
stagnant promotion, did not come from the long days of
intercourse at Byfleet between Colonel Belford and the
Master-General? The opportunities offered by such a meeting
must have been priceless to a man who was so fond of
his Regiment. Nothing is so infectious as enthusiasm; and
we learn from Colonel Belford's orders and letters that he
was an enthusiastic gunner. The early History of the
Regiment is marked by the presence in its ranks of men
eminent in their own way, and perfectly distinct in character,
yet whose talents all worked in the same direction,
the welfare of their corps. Who could be more unlike than
Borgard and his successor, Colonel Belford? And yet a
greater difference is found between the scientific Desaguliers,
and the diplomatic and statesmanlike Pattison, the model
of a liberal-minded, high-spirited soldier. These four men
are the milestones along the road of the Regiment's story
from 1716 to 1783. They mark the stages of continuous
progress; but there the parallel fails. For they were no
stationary emblems. Their whole life was engrossed in
their Regiment. To one, discipline was dear; to another,
military science; to another, gunnery, and the laboratory;
and they drew along with them in the pursuits they loved
all those whose privilege it was to serve under them. It
was in a small and distinct way a representation of what the
Regiment in its present gigantic proportions would be, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the suggestions quoted in the commencement of this volume
were heartily adopted by all who belong to it. Out of the
faded pages and musty volumes which line the walls of
the Regimental Record Office, there seems to come a voice
from these grand old masters, "Be worthy of us!" To
them, their corps was everything; to its advancement every
taste or talent they possessed was devoted. With its increased
proportions, there has now come an increased variety
of tastes, of learning, and of accomplishments; and the lives
of our great predecessors in the corps read like a prayer over
the intervening years, beseeching us all to work together for
the Regiment's good.</p>

<p class='c000'>If variety of taste is to produce opposition in working, or
dissipation of strength and talent, what a cruel answer the
Present gives to the Past! But, if it is to raise the Regiment
in the eyes, not merely of military critics, but of that
other world of science, across whose threshold not a few
Artillerymen have passed with honour, then the variety of
tastes working together, and yet independently—conducing
to the one great end—is the noblest response that can be
made to those who showed us in the Regiment's earliest days
how to forget self in a noble <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> To 1755.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>A number</span> of interesting events can be compressed into a
chapter, covering the period between the end of the
war in Flanders and the year 1755.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dress and equipment of the Regiment underwent a
change. In 1748, the last year of the war, the field staffs of
the gunners, their powder horns, slings, and swords, and the
muskets of the matrosses were laid aside, and both ranks
were armed with carbines and bayonets—thus paving the
way for the step taken in the year 1783, when the distinction
between the two ranks was abolished. The non-commissioned
officers retained their halberds until 1754, when they were
taken from the corporals and bombardiers, who fell into the
ranks with carbines. In 1748, black spatterdashes were
introduced into the Regiment, for the first time into any
British corps. In 1750, the sergeants' coats were laced
round the button-holes with gold looping, the corporals,
bombardiers, and the privates having yellow worsted looping
in the same way. The corporals and bombardiers had gold
and worsted shoulder-knots; the surtouts were laid aside,
and complete suits of clothing were issued yearly.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of the war, the Regiment consisted of ten
companies, and for the first time, reliefs of the companies
abroad were carried out, those at Gibraltar and Minorca
being relieved by companies at Woolwich. The strength of
the Regiment remained unchanged until 1755, when six
new companies were raised, making a total of sixteen, exclusive
of the Cadet company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1751 was marked by several important Regimental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>events. The father of the Regiment, old General
Borgard, died; and was succeeded by Colonel Belford. The
vexed question of the Army rank of Artillery officers was
settled by the King issuing a declaration under his Sign-Manual,
retrospective in its effects, deciding "the rank of
the officers of the Royal Regiment of Artillery to be the
same as that of the other officers of his Army of the same
rank, notwithstanding their commissions having been
hitherto signed by the Master-General, the Lieutenant-General,
or the principal officers of the Ordnance, which
had been the practice hitherto." From this date all commissions
of Artillery officers were signed by the sovereign,
and countersigned by the Master-General of the Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>This year also saw the abolition of an official abuse dating
back before the days of the Regiment's existence. Up to
this time, all non-commissioned officers, gunners, matrosses,
and even drummers, had warrants signed by the Master-General,
and countersigned by his secretary, for which a
sergeant paid 3<em>l.</em>, a matross or drummer, 1<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em>, and the
intermediate grades in proportion.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was now abolished, with great propriety, as an old
MS. says, "as no one purpose appears to have been answered
by it, but picking of the men's pockets." Doubtless, there
were in the Tower officials who would not endorse this statement;
and who were of opinion that a very material purpose
was answered by it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In February of this year, also, the officers of the Regiment
entered into an agreement for the establishment of a fund for
the benefit of their widows, no such fund having as yet existed.
Each officer agreed to subscribe three days' pay annually,
and three days' pay on promotion; but this subscription
apparently was felt to be too high, or it was considered
proper that some assistance should be rendered to the fund
by the Government, for in 1762 a Royal Warrant was issued,
directing one day's pay to be stopped from each officer for the
Widows' Fund, and that one non-effective matross—in other
words a <em>paper</em> man—should be mustered in each company,
the pay of such to be credited to the fund. By this means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>it was hoped that the widow of a Colonel Commandant would
obtain 50<em>l.</em> per annum; of a Lieutenant-Colonel, 40<em>l.</em>; of a
Major, 30<em>l.</em>; of a Captain, 25<em>l.</em>; of a Lieutenant, Chaplain, or
Surgeon, 20<em>l.</em>; and of a Lieutenant-Fireworker, 16<em>l.</em> But,
either the officers would not marry, or the married officers
would not die, for in 1772 another warrant was issued,
announcing that the fund was larger than was necessary,
and directing the surplus to be given as a contingent to the
Captains of companies. It is somewhat anticipating matters,
but it may here be said that a few years later the officers of
the Regiment again took the matter into their own hands,
and formed a marriage society, membership of which was
nominally voluntary, but virtually compulsory, until about
the year 1850, after which it failed to receive the support of
the corps, its rules not being suited to modern ideas. On 13th
May, 1872, these rules were abrogated at a public meeting
of the officers at Woolwich, and the society, with its accumulated
capital of 50,000<em>l.</em>, was thrown open on terms sufficiently
modern and liberal to tempt all who had hitherto refrained
from joining it. At that meeting, the original charter of the
society, signed by the officers serving in the Regiment at
the time, was submitted to their successors, and there was a
dumb eloquence in the faded parchment with its long list
of signatures, which it would be impossible to express in
words.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has already been stated that Colonel Pattison and Major
Lewis had been permitted to retire on full pay, on account
of infirmity. The source from which their income was derived,
and the use to which it was devoted after their death,
can best be described in Colonel Miller's words: "To this
purpose there was appropriated the pay allowed for two
tinmen and twenty-four matrosses, the number of effective
matrosses being reduced from forty-four to forty in each
company, whilst forty-four continued to appear as the
nominal strength. At the death of Jonathan Lewis, a
warrant dated 25th September, 1751, approved of the non-effectives
being still kept up, and directed the sum of
273<em>l.</em> 15<em>s.</em> a year (15<em>s.</em> a day) then available to be applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>thus:—173<em>l.</em> 15<em>s.</em> to Colonel Belford (as colonel commandant),
and 100<em>l.</em> to Catherine Borgard, widow of
Lieutenant-General Albert Borgard, towards the support
of herself and her two children, who were left unprovided
for. When Colonel Thomas Pattison died, a warrant
dated 27th February, 1753, directed that the annuity to
Mrs. Borgard should in future be paid out of another
source, and applied the balance of the fund derived from
the non-effective tinmen and matrosses to increasing the
pay of the fireworkers from 3<em>s.</em> to 3<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> a day."</p>

<p class='c000'>"In 1763 the increased pay of the fireworkers was entered
in the estimates, and the pay of colonel commandant was
raised to 2<em>l.</em> 4<em>s.</em> a day."</p>

<p class='c000'>During the period to which this chapter refers, a review
of the Regiment by the King took place in the Green Park;
and as it was thought worthy of entry in General Macbean's
diary, and shows the way in which the Regiment was formed
upon such an occasion, it may not be deemed out of place in
this work. There were five companies present besides the
Cadets, and the numbers were as follows:—Field officers,
three; Captains, five; Captain-Lieutenants, six; four First, and
seven Second Lieutenants; Lieutenant-Fireworkers, seventeen;
one Chaplain, one Adjutant, one Quartermaster, one
Bridge-master, one Surgeon and his Mate, fifteen Sergeants,
fifteen Corporals, one Drum-Major, ten Drummers and
six Fifers, forty Bombardiers, forty-eight Cadets, ninety-eight
Gunners, and 291 Matrosses. The companies were
formed up as a Battalion; three light 6-pounders being on
the flanks, and the Cadets formed up on the right as a
Battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although there was peace for England in Europe up to
1755, there was no lack of expeditions elsewhere. Besides
Jamaica and Virginia, which demanded guns and stores,
Artillery was required for the East Indies and America. It
was for service in the former country that the augmentation
of four companies with an additional Major was made in
March, 1755.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were raised and equipped in thirty days, and embarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>immediately, the Board giving permission to Major
Chalmers, who was in command, to fill up any vacancies
which might occur, by promoting the senior on the spot.
These companies were in the pay of the East India Company,
and formed part of the expedition under Clive and Admiral
Watson. One of the companies was lost on the passage,
only three men being saved. It was Captain Hislop's company,
but that officer had been promoted while serving in
the East Indies, and it was commanded on the voyage by
the Captain-Lieutenant, N. Jones. As soon as the disaster
was known in England, another company was raised, and on
its arrival in India Captain Hislop assumed the command.
This officer had gone out with five officers, sixty men, and
twelve cadets, and a small train of Artillery, attached to the
39th Regiment, under Colonel Aldercon. His new company
was the last of the Royal Artillery which served in Bengal,
until the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition to America was the ill-fated one commanded
by General Braddock. The detachment of Royal
Artillery was only fifty strong; it left England under the
command of Captain-Lieutenant Robert Hind, with two
Lieutenants, three Fireworkers, and one cadet; and on its
arrival in America was joined by Captain Ord, who assumed
the command. This officer had been quartered with his
company at Newfoundland; but at the request of the Duke
of Cumberland he was chosen to command the Artillery on
this expedition. The guns which accompanied the train
were ten in number, all light brass guns—four being 12-pounders,
and six 6-pounders. The civil attendants of the
train were twenty-one in number, including conductors and
artificers; and there were attached to the train—attendants
not generally found in such lists—"ten servants, and six
necessary women." There were also five Engineers, and
practitioner Engineers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The melancholy fate of this expedition is well known.
The detachment of Artillery was cut to pieces at Fort du
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Quesne, on that ghastly July day in 1755; the whole ten
guns were taken; but Captain Ord himself survived to do
good service years after, on the American continent. It will
be remembered by the reader that George Washington
fought on this occasion on the English side, and displayed
the same marvellous coolness and courage, as he did on
every subsequent occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>But events were ripening at Woolwich for great Regimental
changes. A small subaltern's detachment left for
Dublin, which was to be the parent of the Royal Irish
Artillery, a corps which will form the subject of the next
chapter. In 1756, a company of miners was formed for
service in Minorca, which, on its return to Woolwich, was
incorporated into the Regiment, and two other companies
having been raised in the same year, and four additional in
1757, there was a total, including the companies of miners
and cadets, of twenty-four companies. The largely increased
number of company officers, in proportion to the limited
number of those in the higher grades, made the prospects of
promotion so dismal, that the Regiment was divided into two
Battalions, each of which will receive notice in subsequent
chapters.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Royal Irish Artillery.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> Ordnance Department in Ireland was independent of
that in England until the year 1674, when Charles II.,
availing himself of the vacancy created by the death of the
then Irish Master-General—Sir Robert Byron—merged the
appointment in that of the Master-General of England; and
the combined duties were first performed by Sir Thomas
Chicheley. This officer appointed, as his deputies in Ireland,
Sir James Cuff and Francis Cuff, Esq. The Masters-General
of the Irish Ordnance, whom we find mentioned after this
date, were subordinate to the English Masters-General, in a
way which had never previously been recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even after the amalgamation, however, the accounts of the
Irish and British Departments of the Ordnance were kept
perfectly distinct. When ships were fitted out for service in
the Irish seas, their guns and stores were furnished from the
Irish branch of the Ordnance. All gunpowder for use in
Ireland was issued by the English officials to the Irish
Board on payment; and the lack of funds, which was chronic
at the Tower during the reigns of the Stuarts, was not
unfrequently remedied by calling in the assistance of the
Irish Board. Tenders for the manufacture of gunpowder
having been received, and the orders then given having been
complied with, it was no unusual thing to pay the merchants
with Ordnance Debentures, and to ship the powder to Ireland
in exchange for a money payment. The correspondence
between the two Boards throws light upon the way in which
money was found for the English fortifications, and also
gives us the value of gunpowder at various times. For example,
in August, 1684, one thousand barrels were shipped to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Ireland; and the sum received in payment—2500<em>l.</em>—was
ordered to be spent on the fortifications at Portsmouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the debentures issued to the creditors of the
English Ordnance, in lieu of money, were on security of the
grounds in the City of London, called the Artillery Grounds,
and carried interest at the rate of two per cent.: others were
merely promissory notes issued by the Board, which bore no
very high reputation, nor were they easily convertible into
money. From certain correspondence in the Tower Library,
during the reigns of Charles II. and James II., it would
appear that the Board could not be sued before the Law
Courts for the amount of their debts;—the letter-books of
that period teeming with piteous appeals from the defrauded
creditors.</p>

<p class='c000'>One unhappy man writes that in consequence of the
inability of the Board to meet his claims, he "had undergone
extreme hardships, even to imprisonment, loss of employment,
and reputation." Another in the same year, 1682,
writes, that "he is in a very necessitous and indigent condition,
having not wherewithal to supply his want and
necessity; and he doth in all humility tender his miserable
condition to your Honours' consideration."</p>

<p class='c000'>During periods of actual or expected disturbance in
Ireland, stores for that country were often accumulated in
Chester, and on the Welsh coast, ready for shipment; from
which it may be inferred, that the arrangements in Ireland
for their safe keeping were inadequate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The formation of a battalion of Artillery on the Irish
establishment was not contemplated until the year 1755,
when, on the requisition of the Lord-Lieutenant, a party of
twenty-four non-commissioned officers and men of the Royal
Artillery, under the command of a First Lieutenant, left
Woolwich for Dublin, for that purpose. This detachment,
having received considerable augmentation and a special
organization, was in the following year styled "The Artillery
Company in Ireland," the commissions of the officers being
dated the 1st of April, 1756. The company consisted of a
Major, a Captain, one First and one Second Lieutenant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>three Lieutenant-Fireworkers, five Sergeants, five Corporals,
one hundred and six Bombardiers, thirty-four Gunners, one
hundred and two Matrosses, and two Drummers. The large
number of Bombardiers suggests a special service, probably
in the bomb-vessels, for which this class was employed.
Major Brownrigg, the commandant of the corps, was replaced
in 1758, by Major D. Chevenix, from the 11th Dragoons.
Two years later, the company was considerably increased,
and was styled the "Regiment of Royal Irish Artillery."
It had now a Colonel-in-Chief, and another <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en seconde</span></i>, a
Lieutenant-Colonel commandant, a Major, four Captains,
four First and four Second Lieutenants, and four Lieutenant-Fireworkers.
The Masters-General of the Irish Ordnance
were <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i> Colonels-in-Chief of the Irish Artillery. The
following is a list of those who held this appointment
during the existence of the corps: James, Marquis of Kildare,
Richard, Earl of Shannon, Charles, Marquis of Drogheda,
Henry, Earl of Carhampton, and the Hon. Thomas
Pakenham.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reductions were made in the Regiment at the conclusion
of peace in 1763, and again in 1766; but they were chiefly
confined to weeding the Regiment of undersized men. In
1774, the rank of Lieutenant-Fireworker was abolished,
three years later than the same change had been made in
England. In 1778, the Regiment was augmented from four
to six companies, the total of the establishment being raised
from 228 to 534; and from that date the senior first lieutenant
received the rank of Captain-Lieutenant. A further
addition of seventy-eight gunners raised the total to 612,
and caused an increase in the number of officers, four Second
Lieutenants being added in 1782.</p>

<p class='c000'>In August, 1783, an invalid company was added, consisting
of a captain, first and second lieutenant, one sergeant,
two corporals, one drummer, three bombardiers, four gunners,
and thirty-nine matrosses, and with a few additions to the
marching companies raised the establishment to 701. But
in three months, a most serious reduction can be traced,
not in the cadres, nor among the higher commissioned ranks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>but among the subalterns, and the rank and file, and the
total fell to 386.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the monthly returns for October, 1783, we find that
the title of matross, although retained in the invalid company,
was otherwise abolished; the private soldiers being
now all designated gunners. From 1783 to 1789, the establishment
remained at 386; and in 1791, it was the same.
The returns for the intermediate year have been lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1793, recruiting on a large scale can be traced, and we
find, that in October, 1794, by successive augmentations, the
establishment had reached a total of no less than 2069 of
all ranks, organized into one invalid and twenty marching
companies. By a King's letter, dated 20th May, 1795, these
were constituted into two Battalions, the company of invalids
remaining distinct. This gave an addition of thirteen Field
and Staff Officers, and three Staff Sergeants, raising the total
establishment from 2069 to 2085. Each company consisted
of 100 of all ranks—except the invalid company, which remained
at a total of fifty-three, until 1st October, 1800, when
it was raised to 100—and the strength of the Regiment
reached its maximum, 2132.</p>

<p class='c000'>This establishment continued, until the 1st of March,
1801, when, in anticipation of the amalgamation with the
Royal Artillery, eight companies, with a proportion of Field
Officers, were reduced, followed next month by a reduction
of two more.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 1st April, 1801, the remaining ten marching companies,
with Field and Staff Officers, were incorporated with
the Royal Artillery, and numbered as the 7th Battalion of
that corps. By General Order of 17th September, 1801, the
invalid company was transferred to the battalion of invalids
on the British establishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a singular coincidence that the officer of the Royal
Artillery, who forty-six years before had left Woolwich to
organize the first company of the Royal Irish Artillery,
should, on the amalgamation, have been the Colonel commandant
of the new Battalion. Lieutenant-General Straton
had proceeded, in May, 1755, to Ireland, for the former purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and he rejoined the Royal Artillery on the 1st April,
1801, as Colonel commandant of the 7th Battalion. He died
in Dublin on the 16th May, 1803, after a service of sixty-one
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of the amalgamation, six of the companies
were stationed in Ireland, and four in the West Indies. The
Irish Artillery was not exempt from foreign service, and the
conduct of the men abroad was as excellent as it always was
during the times of even the greatest civil commotion.
When, however, they left Ireland on service, their pay
became a charge on the English Office of Ordnance; and in
the Returns from their own head-quarters we find that any
men who might be in England, pending embarkation, were
shown as "on foreign service."</p>

<p class='c000'>The first employment of the Irish Artillery abroad was
during the American war. In March, 1777, seventy men
embarked, under the command of an officer of the Royal
Artillery, and did duty with that corps in a manner which
called forth the highest commendations from the officers
under whom they served. The Master-General of the Ordnance,
Lord Townsend, in a letter to the officer commanding
the Irish Artillery, dated 23rd of December, 1777, alludes to
these men in the following terms: "I am informed that
none among the gallant troops behaved so nobly as the
Irish Artillery, who are now exchanged, and are to return.
I am sorry they have suffered so much, but it is the lot of
brave men, who, so situated, prefer glorious discharge of
their duty to an unavailing desertion of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>The conduct of the Irish Artillery, both in America and in
the darkest period of their service, in the West Indies, contrasts
so strongly with that of the men enlisted in Ireland
for the Royal Artillery at the same time, that evidently the
recruiting for the latter corps must have been grossly mismanaged,
or, what is more probable, the national corps
obtained with ease the best men, while the refuse of the
country was left to the recruiting sergeants of the Royal
Artillery. In the correspondence of General Pattison, who
at one period of the American war commanded the Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Artillery on that continent, the language employed in describing
the recruits enlisted in Ireland, and sent to join the
3rd and 4th Battalions in America, would be strong in
any one, but is doubly so, coming from an officer always
most courteous in his language, and by no means given to
exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three companies of the Irish Artillery embarked for the
Continent in 1794, and served in Flanders and the Netherlands,
under the Duke of York. But, as has already been
hinted, the most severe foreign service undergone by the
corps was in the West Indies. In 1793, three companies
embarked for these islands, and took honourable part during
the following year, in the capture of Martinique, Guadaloupe,
and St. Lucia, as well as in the more general operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their strength, on embarkation, had been 15 Officers and
288 non-commissioned officers and men. In less than two
years, only forty-three of the men were alive, and of the
officers, only four returned to Europe. It accordingly became
necessary to reinforce the companies by drafts from
Ireland; and in addition to these, two other companies
sailed in the winter of 1795; thus bringing the total
strength serving in the West Indies to 500 of all ranks. In
less than two years, a further reinforcement of 176 officers,
non-commissioned officers, and men, was found necessary to
repair the ravages of the climate upon the troops; and apparently
further drafts in the following year were only
avoided, by transferring the head-quarters of one of the companies
to the home establishment, and absorbing the men in
the others. Four of the companies were still in the West
Indies, when the amalgamation took place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certain details connected with the organization of the
Irish Artillery, immediately prior to their incorporation with
the Royal Artillery, remain to be mentioned. On the 19th
September, 1798, Lord Carhampton, then Master-General of
the Irish Ordnance, notified to the officer commanding the
corps, that the formation of the Artillery in Ireland into
<em>Brigades</em> had been decided upon; the Brigades to be distinguished
as heavy and light. The establishment of a Heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Brigade was to include four medium 12-pounders, and two
5½-inch howitzers:—of a Light Brigade, four light 6-pounder
Battalion guns. The former was to be manned by forty-eight
non-commissioned officers and men, the latter by
thirty-seven—of the Regiment; while the guns and waggons
were to be horsed and driven by the Driver Corps. This
improved organization superseded the system of Battalion
guns; for while, in September, 1798, one hundred of the
Irish Artillery were returned as being attached to these, in
November only thirty-seven were so employed; in the
following January, only four; and in March, 1799, all were
finally withdrawn. The additional gunners from the Militia,
who had, at the date of the new organization, been 213 in
number, were gradually reduced by its operation, and in
the monthly return for September, 1799, they disappear
altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at first proposed that the 12-pounders and the
howitzers of the Heavy Brigades should be drawn by four
horses, and the 6-pounders of the Light Brigades by three;
but subsequently a 4½-inch howitzer having been added to
each Light Brigade, the number of horses to each gun was
apparently increased from three to four, and the total number
of horses to each Heavy Brigade was seventy-three;—to each
Light Brigade, fifty-one. The "two leading horses were
ridden by Artillerymen, and the gun was driven by a
driver."<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> This arrangement applied also to the ammunition
waggons. The harness-maker, wheeler, and smith, each
rode a spare horse with harness on.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the guns had four horses, the howitzers in Heavy
Brigades had but three, and in Light Brigades only a pair.
The Driver Corps furnished to each Heavy Brigade 1 officer,
1 quartermaster, 3 non-commissioned officers, and 26 privates;
to each Light Brigade, 5 non-commissioned officers and 14
privates. For the information of the general reader, it may
be stated that the Brigades of the Irish Artillery were
analogous to the present Field Batteries; the modern Brigade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of Artillery meaning a number of Batteries linked together
for administrative purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January, 1799, there were twenty-five Brigades in
Ireland, and at this point they remained until the amalgamation
with the Royal Artillery. Although it is not probable
that they were all horsed at that date, there were no
less than 1027 officers and men at the appointed stations of
the Brigades, and in the language of an old document in the
Royal Artillery Record Office, "the New Irish Field Artillery
had not only form, but consistency."</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these Brigades of Field Artillery, the
Regiment was divided into detachments—generally eight in
number,—stationed in the chief harbours, garrisons, and
forts, for service with heavy ordnance. The invalid company
was scattered over the country, many of the non-commissioned
officers and men being totally unfit for service.
The Regiment was actively employed in the field during the
Rebellion; "and it must be recorded to the honour of the
Royal Irish Regiment of Artillery, that though exposed to
every machination of the disaffected, and to the strongest
temptations, they preserved throughout an unsullied
character, and manifested on all occasions a true spirit of
loyalty, zeal, and fidelity to His Majesty's service and
Government."<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The dress of the Royal Irish Artillery was as follows:—Blue
coat with scarlet facings, cuff and collar gold embroidered;
yellow worsted lace being used for all beneath
the rank of corporal; gold-laced cocked hat, black leather
cockade, white cloth breeches, with short gaiters and white
stockings in summer, and long gaiters in winter. The non-commissioned
officers and men wore their hair powdered and
clubbed. In 1798 jackets were introduced according to the
pattern adopted for the Army; and the gold lace was removed
from the cocked hats.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the date of the amalgamation the Regiment was armed
with cavalry carbines,—the bayonet and pouch, containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>from sixteen to eighteen rounds, being carried on the same
belt. A cross belt was also worn to which the great-coat
was suspended, resting on the left hip. At an earlier period,
the Regiment had been armed with long Queen Anne's fusils,
which were replaced, when worn out, by arms of various
patterns, until at length the cavalry carbine was adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>One cannot but be struck—in studying the history of this
national corps of Artillery—with the rapidity of its formation,
and its attainment of high discipline and professional knowledge,—keeping
pace in its career of half a century with the
constant changes, with which even in those days this arm
was harassed; nor can one read without pride and interest
those pages of loyalty at home, gallantry on service abroad,
and patient endurance under suffering and disease in the
West Indies,—at once as fatal as active war, and yet destitute
of the excitement which in war enables the soldier willingly
to undergo any hardship.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>In</span> the beginning of the year 1757, the Regiment consisted
of nineteen companies, with four field officers. On the
2nd April four additional companies were added, giving a
total of twenty-four companies, inclusive of the Cadet Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was no organization in existence corresponding
to the Battalion, or present Brigade, system. The number
of company officers was very great, being no less than 140
at the end of 1756; and as there were only four field officers,
the prospect of promotion to the younger men was very
disheartening. By introducing the Battalion system, and
dividing the companies in some way which should give an
excuse for an augmentation in the higher ranks, stagnation
would be less immediate, and discontent among the junior
ranks postponed. Charles, Duke of Marlborough, being then
Master-General, approved of this change, and the Regiment
was on the 1st August, 1757, divided into two Battalions,
each having three field officers, and a separate staff. The
strength of the Regiment, after this change had been introduced,
was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The recruiting of Battalions was always carried on by means
of parties scattered over England and Scotland, but the men
so obtained were liable to be transferred to other Battalions,
whose wants might be greater. This system, which still
obtains, prevents, and perhaps wisely, any great Battalion,
or Brigade <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>. The real <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i> should be for the
Regiment first, and then for the Battery. The organization,
by whatever name it may be called, which links a certain
number of Batteries together for special purposes, has never
been allowed the official respect which is paid to the Battalion
system in the Infantry. In the absence of such respect,
and in the knowledge that the men who might receive their
instruction in one Brigade or Battalion were liable to transfer
to another, immediately on the completion of their drills, is
to be found the reason why both in the days of Battalions
and Brigades there has been no <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i> found strong enough
to weaken that which should exist in every Artilleryman's
mind for his Regiment at large, instead of for a detail of it.
At the same time, the transfer system can be carried to an
injurious extent. The instruction of recruits is more likely
to be thorough, if the instructor feels that he himself is
likely to retain under his command those whom he educates.
The consciousness that the "<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic vos non vobis</span></i>" system is to
be applied to himself must diminish to a certain extent his
zeal in instruction. And therefore while no one should be
allowed to imagine that his own Battery or his own Brigade
is to be considered before the Regiment at large, there can
be no doubt that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Depôt</span> system for feeding the Regimental
wants is far less cruel than that by which volunteers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>are called, or transfers ordered, from one portion of the
Regiment to another.</p>

<p class='c000'>The establishment of the 1st Battalion varied very much
with the signs of the times. Before the Peninsular War,
its greatest strength was in 1758, the year after its formation,
when it consisted of 13 companies, and a total of 1383
of all ranks. In 1772, it fell to 8 companies, with a total
of 437; but during the American War of Independence, it
reached a total of 1259, divided into 11 companies. After
the peace of 1783, it was again reduced, falling to a total of
648, in ten companies. During the Peninsular War, the
average strength of the Battalion was 1420, the number of
companies remaining the same; but as only one company
of the Battalion served in the Peninsula, its increased
numbers were evidently intended to assist in feeding the
companies of other Battalions. After Waterloo it was greatly
reduced, and for the next thirty years, its average strength
was 700, in 8 companies. In 1846, it rose to a total of 842,
and on the outbreak of the War with Russia, in which no
fewer than five companies of the Battalion were engaged,
further augmentations took place, the totals standing during
the war as follows: in 1854, 1208; in 1855, 1336; and in
1856, 1468.</p>

<p class='c000'>The names of the various Captains who have successively
commanded the companies of the 1st Battalion, down to the
introduction of the Brigade system, and the new nomenclature
in 1859, are given in the following pages, as far as the
state of the Battalion Records will admit. The list of
the various military operations in which they were severally
engaged is also given; and the names which the companies
received at the reorganization referred to. It has been
thought advisable to give this now in a short but complete
form, but in studying the various campaigns, the services of
the companies alluded to will occasionally receive more
detailed notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be remembered that the history of these companies
is the legitimate property of the Batteries, which represent
them. It is hoped that the publication of their antecedents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>in this way will not merely interest those in any way connected
with them, but will create a feeling of pride which
will materially aid discipline, and check negligence. It is
believed that with such a past to appeal to as many of the
Batteries will find they have, a commander will find a weapon
in dealing with his men more powerful than the most penal
code, for in each line there seems to be a voice speaking from
the dead, and urging those who are, to be worthy of those
who have been.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Second Battalion.—The History and Present<br /> Designation of the Companies.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Formed</span> in 1757, at the same time as the 1st Battalion,
the 2nd Battalion at first included companies in all
parts of the world—the East Indies, America, Gibraltar, and
England. The Cadet Company belonged to it, and was one
of the twelve which constituted the Battalion; but in 1758
another service company was added, making it, in respect of
service companies, equal to the 1st Battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its strength in 1758 amounted to a total of 1385, divided
into thirteen companies. This strength was reduced in the
following year by the transfer of three companies to assist
in the formation of the 3rd Battalion. One company was
again added in 1761, and two taken away when the 4th
Battalion was formed in 1771. During the American War
two companies were again added, and the greatest strength
of all ranks was 1145. In 1793 and 1794 it approached
1300; and during the Peninsular War its average strength
was 1460. While the Crimean War lasted the Battalion consisted
of eight companies, and its strength was as follows:—In
1854, 1216; in 1855, 1344; and in 1856, 1480.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distinctive mark of this Battalion was the fact, that
the only Artillery present during the memorable siege of
Gibraltar belonged to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early services of the companies are difficult to trace.
One company, under Captain Hislop, was present at the
defence of Fort St. George, Madras, when besieged by the
French, in October, 1758. In November of the same year a
company of the Battalion, under Captain P. Innes, embarked
with General Barrington's expedition, for the attack of the
Island of Martinique. This expedition was unsuccessful, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the troops were then ordered against Guadaloupe, which was
taken on 1st May, 1759. In February, 1759, the siege of Fort
St. George was raised by the French, Captain Hislop's
Company receiving great praise for its conduct during the
defence.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='sc'>During the Seven Years' War.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>At</span> this time the Regiment well deserved the motto it now
bears, "Ubique." The feeling uppermost in the mind
of one who has been studying its records between 1756 and
1763 is one of astonishment and admiration. Only forty
years before, the Royal Artillery was represented by two
companies at Woolwich; now we find it serving in the
East and West Indies, in North America, in the Mediterranean,
in Germany, in Belleisle, and in Britain, and yet it
was by no means a large Regiment. In 1756 it contained
eighteen companies, and by the end of the war it had increased
to thirty, exclusive of the cadets; but when we
reflect on the detached nature of their service, we cannot
but marvel at the work they did. If England must always
look back with pride to the annals of this war, so also must
the Royal Artilleryman look back to this period of his Regimental
History with amazement and satisfaction. It was a
wonderful time,—a time bristling with ubiquitous victories,—a
time teeming with chivalrous memories—Clive in the
East, and Wolfe in the West—British soldiers conquering
under Prince Ferdinand at Minden, under Lord Albemarle
at the Havannah, under Amherst at Louisbourg, and under
Hodgson at Belleisle,—English Artillerymen winning
honours and promotion from a foreign prince in Portugal;
and at the end, when the Peace of Paris allowed the nations
to cast up the columns in their balance-sheet, England,
finding Canada all her own, Minorca restored to her, and
nineteen-twentieths of India acknowledging her sovereignty.
It was a golden time: who can paint it? Who can select
enough of its episodes to satisfy the reader, and yet not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>weary him with glut of triumph? And shall it be by continents
that the deeds of our soldiers shall be watched? or on
account of popular leaders? or by value of results?</p>

<p class='c000'>With much thought and hesitation it has been resolved in
this work to choose subjects for complex reasons. Who can
think of England's Field Artillery without thinking, at such
a time as this was, of Minden?—of her siege Artillery,
without remembering Belleisle? And yet what would the
History of the Regiment at such a period in England's
annals be, if the names of Phillips, Macbean, and Desaguliers
were unspoken?</p>

<p class='c000'>Happy coincidence that enables the historian to combine
both,—that bids him, as he writes of Minden, write also of
Phillips, who was the head, and Macbean, who was the
hand, of the corps on that proud day; and as he tells of the
wet and miserable trenches at Belleisle, with the boom of
its incessant bombardment, tell also of him, the brave, the
learned Desaguliers, wounded, yet ever at his post! But is
this all? The Seven Years' War, without America having
a chapter given—America, which was the cradle of the war,
as it was the scene of its greatest triumphs! Where shall
we turn to choose on that continent some scene which shall
be noble and pleasant to tell, and shall not wander from the
purpose of this work? The mind clings instinctively to
Wolfe, eager to narrate something of the Regiment's story
over which his presence shall shed a lustre, in memory as in
life. Quebec is eagerly studied, reluctantly laid aside, for
on that sad and glorious day only a handful of Artillerymen
mustered on the Plains of Abraham. So the student wanders
backward from that closing scene, and on the shores of that
bay in Cape Breton where Louisbourg once stood in arms,
he finds a theme in which Wolfe and this Regiment, whose
history he fain would write, were joint and worthy actors.
And what prouder comrade could one have than he who
was the Washington of England in bravery, in gentleness, in
the adoration of his men?</p>

<p class='c000'>These three episodes of the war, therefore, have been
selected for separate mention. In the present chapter the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>general outline of the war will be glanced at, and domestic
occurrences in the Regiment described.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Seven Years' War owed its immediate origin to the
quarrels in America between England and France. Under
the impression that the time was favourable for recovering
Silesia, which had been awarded to Prussia at the Peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria secured Russia, Saxony, and Sweden
as allies, and ultimately France; while Prussia obtained the
alliance of England. The commencement of the war was
unfavourable to England. Minorca and Hanover fell into
the hands of the French, and remained so until the end of
the war. But they were avenged by the victories of the
British troops under Prince Ferdinand at Crevelt and Minden;
and by the victories of the King of Prussia over the Austrians
at Prague and Rosbach. The capture of Belleisle by
the English compensated, to a certain extent, for the loss
of Minorca. The capture of Louisbourg, Quebec, Montreal,
and ultimately the whole of Canada, added lustre to the
English arms in the West, as that of Pondicherry did in the
East; while even Africa contributed its share to English
triumph, in the capture of Senegal from the French.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not until 1758 that the first Artillery was sent
to Germany. It was increased in the following year, and
a further reinforcement was sent in 1760, increasing the
whole to five companies. Two companies were sent to
America in 1757, to swell the Artillery force already there,
with a view to the reduction of Louisbourg and the subjugation
of Canada. Two, besides a number of detachments,
were at Belleisle in 1761; the company at Gibraltar was
increased by another; two companies were sent to Portugal
after France had formed the Treaty known as the Family
Compact; four were in the East Indies; two companies,
besides a number of detachments, accompanied Lord Albemarle
to the Havannah; and a detachment went to Senegal.
This summary—not including the numerous detachments on
board the bomb-vessels—is sufficient to give some idea of the
ubiquitous duties performed by the Regiment during this
time.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The increase in the number of companies which took place
during the Seven Years' War was accompanied by the formation
of another Battalion (the Third), whose history will
therefore, be given in proper chronological place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although three episodes have been selected for more
detailed mention than the others, it would not be just to omit
all notice of the other events which occurred in the Regiment's
history at this time. Turning to the East, there are
many pages in the old records which speak eloquently,
though quaintly, of service done at this time by the corps
in India. A mixed force, under the command of Captain
Richard Maitland, R.A., was ordered by the Governor of
Bombay to proceed, in February, 1759, against the City and
Castle of Surat. Captain Maitland's and Captain Northall's
companies were present with the force, but the last-named
officer died of sunstroke on the march. "The first attack,"
writes Captain Maitland, "that we made was against the
French garden, where the enemy (Seydees) had lodged a
number of men. Them we drove out, after a very smart
firing on both sides for about four hours, our number lost
consisting of about twenty men killed and as many
wounded. After we had got possession of the French
garden, I thought it necessary to order the Engineer to
pitch upon a proper place to erect a battery, which he
did, and completed it in two days. On the battery were
mounted two 24-pounders and a 13-inch mortar, which I
ordered to fire against the wall, &amp;c., as brisk as possible.
After three days' bombarding from the batteries and the
armed vessels, I formed a general attack, driving the enemy
from their batteries, and carrying the outer town, with its
fortifications. The same evening I commenced firing from
the 13 and 10-inch mortars on the inner town and castle,
distant 500 and 700 yards. The continual firing of our
batteries caused such consternation, and the impossibility
of supporting themselves caused the Governor to open the
gates of the town, and offering to give up the castle if I
would allow him and his people to march out with their
effects. We got possession without further molestation."
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Captain Maitland, who seems to have been more proficient
with his sword than his pen, died in India in 1763.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene changes to Manilla; and on a faded page the
student reads how a company of Artillery arrived off that
island on the 23rd September, 1762, with General Draper's
force, and made good their landing next morning with three
field-guns and one howitzer. By the 26th the batteries were
ready for heavier ordnance; and eight 24-pounders were
placed in one, and 10 and 13-inch mortars in another. And
here the dim page is illumined by a sentence dear to the
student's heart:—"The officers of Artillery and Engineers
exercising themselves in a manner that nothing but their
zeal for the public service could have inspired." On the
5th October, so violent had been the fire of the Artillery,
that the breach appeared practicable; and at daylight on the
morning of the 6th, after a general discharge from all the
batteries, the troops rushed to the assault. The Governor
and principal officers retired to the citadel, and surrendered
themselves prisoners at discretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the scene changes. On the 5th March, 1762, Lord
Albemarle's expedition left Portsmouth for the Havannah.
The Royal Artillery consisted of Captain Buchanan's and
Captain Anderson's companies, with Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonels
Leith<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> and Cleveland, Captain-Lieutenant Williamson
as a Volunteer, and Lieutenants Lee, Lemoine, and
Blomefield for duty on board the bomb-vessels. On reaching
Barbadoes news is received of the capitulation of Martinique
to General Monckton's force, and the fleet steers for that
island. Here large reinforcements from America meet them,
including Captain Strachey's company, which brings the
strength of the Artillery up to 377 of all ranks. On the
6th June the expedition reaches Havannah, and a landing
is effected six miles to the eastward of the Moro, which it
is resolved to besiege first. And here the story becomes a
purely Artillery matter. Two batteries were opened—one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>against the Moro, at 192 yards distance, called the grand
battery, and one for howitzers, to annoy the shipping.
Repeated and unsuccessful sallies were made by the enemy;
and still battery after battery was made and opened by the
English. On the 1st July four batteries opened fire—from
twelve 24-pounders, six 13-inch, three 10-inch, and 26
Royal mortars. On the 3rd July another was completed;
and on the 16th sixteen additional guns were brought into
play and so well served that the besieged were reduced to
six guns. But there were other enemies than man to contend
with. Twice the Grand Battery took fire, and the
second time it was entirely consumed. Fresh provisions
became scarce, and water equally so. No words can paint
what followed better than the short sentence which meets
the student's eye:—"The scanty supply of water exhausted
their strength, and, joined to the anguish of dreadful thirst,
put an end to the existence of many. Five thousand
soldiers and three thousand sailors were laid up with
various distempers."<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> On the 22nd,—a lodgment having
been effected on the glacis,—it was found necessary to have
recourse to mining; and on the 30th the mines were sprung
and the place carried by storm. Fresh batteries were now
formed, and the guns of the Moro turned against the town.
On the 11th August forty-five guns and eight mortars opened
on the town with such fury, that flags of truce were soon
hung up all round the town, and on the following day the
articles of capitulation were signed; the principal gates of
the town were taken possession of; the English colours were
hoisted; and Captain Duncan took possession of the men-of-war
in the harbour.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The death vacancies in the Artillery, which were very
numerous, had been filled up on the spot by Lord Albemarle,
who not merely gave the promotions, but also made first appointments
as Lieutenant-Fireworkers from among the cadets
and non-commissioned officers present with the companies.
The whole of these promotions were ratified by the Board in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the following year; but an opportunity was taken at the
same time of informing the Regiment that "Lieutenant-Colonel
Cleveland's brevet is not to allow of his ranking
otherwise than as Major in the Regiment," although his
pay would be that of the higher rank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet again and again, from east to west and west to east,
do the scenes in the Regimental drama at this time change.
From Newfoundland we hear of a gallant band of fifty-eight
Artillerymen under Captain Ferguson, with a train of no less
than twenty-nine pieces, being present with Colonel Amherst
at the recapture of that island, after its brief occupation
by the French. And from Portugal comes a letter from
Lord London in October, 1762: "In the action of Villa
Vella, Major Macbean, with four field-pieces, joined, having
used the greatest diligence in his march. The force
retiring, Major Macbean's guns formed part of the rear-guard,
which he conducted so effectually, that hardly any
shot was fired that did not take place among the enemy....
Major Macbean of the Artillery is an officer whose
zeal and ability, upon this and every other occasion, justly
entitle him to the warmest recommendations I can possibly
give him."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time, what was going on in England?</p>

<p class='c000'>An unsuccessful expedition was ordered in July, 1757, to
Rochfort, in which Captain James's company was engaged.
On its return in October the Company was sent to Scarborough.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 5th June, 1758, we find 400 Artillerymen with
sixty guns forming part of an expedition against St. Malo
under Charles, Duke of Marlborough; but little was done
except destroying a large number of French vessels. The
subsequent attack and capture of Cherbourg was more successful,
and the number of guns taken from the enemy
enabled the Government to get up a display in London—utterly
out of proportion to the actual danger and loss incurred
by the troops, but intended to gratify the populace—which
may be described in a few words. "The cannon and
mortars taken at Cherbourg passed by His Majesty, set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>out from Hyde Park and came through the City in grand
procession, guarded by a company of matrosses, with
drums beating and fifes playing all the way to the Tower,
where they arrived at four o'clock in the afternoon. There
were twenty-three carriages drawn by 229 horses, with a
postilion and driver to each carriage in the following
manner:—The first, drawn by fifteen grey horses, with the
English colours and the French underneath; seven ditto,
drawn by thirteen horses each; nine ditto by nine horses
each; three ditto by seven horses each; one ditto by five
horses; then the two mortars, by nine horses each."</p>

<p class='c000'>And at Woolwich, what was going on? Promotion was
brisk, with death so busy all over the world; officers got
their commissions when very young; and the age of the
cadets fell in proportion. Hence we feel no surprise that
the legislation for these young gentlemen occupies a considerable
part of the order-books of the period. But the
remaining orders are not destitute of interest. One, dated
1st October, 1758, introduces a name which has been familiar
to the Regiment ever since in the same capacity: "R. Cox,
Esq., is appointed Paymaster to the Royal Regiment of
Artillery." The division of the Regiment into Battalions
rendered many orders necessary. It was now for the first
time laid down that the quartermasters were responsible for
the clothing and equipment until handed over to the captains.
A separate roster was kept for detachments, which,
however, was not to interfere with officers accompanying
their own men, when the whole company moved. Promotion
from matross to gunner was ordered never to be
made without submitting the case to the Lieutenant-General
of the Ordnance, in the same manner as the promotion
of non-commissioned officers. No non-commissioned
officer was to be recommended for promotion who had not
written in full for the examination of his Captain the
names and different parts of guns and mortars, their carriages
and beds, and also a full description of a gyn.
And at every parade the Captain of the week was to take
care that the men were made acquainted with the names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of all the different parts of a gun and carriage, and of a
gyn, and once a day to mount and dismount a gun. Every
man was supplied with three rounds of ball-cartridge,
without which he was never to go on duty; when discharged,
an English gunner received a fortnight's pay; a Scotchman
received a month's, provided he had been enlisted in Scotland;
no Irishman was on any account allowed at this time
to be enlisted for the Royal Artillery; no recruit was permitted
leave of absence until he had been dismissed drill; no
man on guard was to "extort money from any prisoner on
any pretence whatsoever;" no man was to pull off his
clothes or accoutrements during the hours of exercise; no
pay-sergeant was allowed to pay the men in a public-house;
the drummers and fifers were, when on duty, always to wear
their swords; any pay-sergeant lending money <em>at a premium</em>
to any of the men was to be tried and reduced to the rank of
matross, and any man consenting to be imposed upon in this
respect would receive no further advancement in the Regiment.
No men were allowed to enter the Laboratory in their
new clothing. Every recruit for the Regiment at this time
received a guinea and a crown as bounty, provided he were
medically fit, 5 feet 9 inches in height, and not over 25 years
of age.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the orders would lose their quaintness, if curtailed.</p>

<p class='c000'>November 19, 1758. "Complaint having been made of
the Greenwich guard for milking the cows belonging to
Combe Farm, the Sergeant of that guard to be answerable
for such theft, who will be broke and punished if he suffer
it for the future, and does not take care to prevent it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Jan. 6, 1759. "The Paymasters of each company are to
clear with the nurse of the hospital once a week. No man
is to be allowed within the nurse's apartment."</p>

<p class='c000'>March 19, 1759. "The sentries to load with a running
ball, and when the Officer of the Guard goes his rounds,
they are to drop the muzzles of their pieces to show him
that they are properly loaded."</p>

<p class='c000'>June 14, 1758. "In drilling with the Battalion guns
the man who loads the gun is to give the word 'Fire,' as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>it is natural to believe he will not do it till he believes
himself safe; and he who gives the word 'Fire' is not to
attempt to sponge until he hears the report of the gun."</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to officers, the order-books at this time
divided their attention pretty equally between the Surgeon
and his mate, who had a playful habit of being out of the
way when wanted, and that favourite theme, the young
officers. Much fatherly advice, which in more modern times
would be given verbally, was given then through the channel
of the Regimental order-book. Nor was the system more
successful, if one may judge from the frequent repetitions of
neglected orders. Various orders as to dress were given,
from which we learn that boots for the officers and black
spatterdashes for the men were the ordinary covering for
their extremities on parade—white spatterdashes with their
six-and-thirty buttons being reserved for grand occasions.
It was a very serious crime to wear a black stock,—white
being the orthodox colour—and the lace from the officers'
scarlet waistcoats was removed at this period. Very great
attention was paid at this time to perfecting the officers, old
and young, in the knowledge of laboratory duties, nor was any
exemption allowed. From the order-books of this date, also,
we learn that officers' servants were chosen from among the
matrosses; and that, on a man becoming a gunner, he ceased
to be a servant. Nor was a matross allowed to be made
gunner until a recruit was found to fill his vacancy in the
lower grade. As now, the practice prevailed then, whenever a
man in debt was transferred from one company to another, of
making the Captain who received the man reimburse the
Captain who handed him over, repaying himself by stoppages
from the man's pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this general glance at the Regiment during the
Seven Years' War, the History will now proceed to a somewhat
fuller examination of the three important episodes in
that War, which have been selected.</p>

<p class='c014'><em>N.B.</em>—Good service was rendered at Guadaloupe in 1759 by a Company
under Major S. Cleaveland, and at Martinique in 1762 by two Companies
under Lieutenant-Colonel Ord.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Siege of Louisbourg.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> year in which the Regiment was divided into two
Battalions witnessed the commencement in America of
military operations which were to result in the complete
removal of French authority from Canada.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Ord's company, which had suffered so grievously
at Fort du Quesne in 1755, having been reinforced from
England, was joined in 1757 by two companies under
Colonel George Williamson, and a large staff of artificers,
the whole being intended to form part of an expedition
against the French town of Louisbourg in Cape Breton, now
part of the province of Nova Scotia. It was to be Colonel
Williamson's good fortune to command the Royal Artillery
in America until, in 1760, the English power was fully
established on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the English captured Annapolis and Placentia in
the beginning of the 18th century, the French garrisons
were allowed to settle in Louisbourg, which place they very
strongly fortified. Its military advantages were not very
great, had an attack from the land side been undertaken,
for it was surrounded by high ground; but it had an admirable
harbour, and it was very difficult to land troops
against the place from the sea side of the town. The harbour
lies open to the south-east, and is nearly six miles long,
with an average depth of seven fathoms, and an excellent
anchorage. There was abundance of fuel in the neighbourhood,
both wood and coal; in fact, the whole island was full
of both; and there were casemates in the town which could
greatly shelter the women and children during a bombardment.
Generally some French men-of-war were in the
harbour; and in 1757, when the siege was first proposed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>be undertaken, so strong was the French fleet at Louisbourg,
that the English commanders postponed their operations
until the following year. Had our statesmen been better
acquainted with geography, it is probable that at the Peace
of Utrecht, when Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were authoritatively
pronounced to be English territory, Cape Breton
would have also been included; but being an island, and
separate from Nova Scotia although immediately adjoining
it, the French did not consider that it fell within the treaty,
and clung to it, as they always had to the maritime provinces
of Canada.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege of 1758 was not the first to which Louisbourg had
been subjected. In 1745 an expedition had been fitted out
from Massachusetts—the land forces being American Militia
under Colonel Pepperell, and the naval contingent being
composed of English men-of-war under Commodore Warren.
The amicable relations between the naval and military commanders
tended greatly to bring about the ultimate success.</p>

<p class='c000'>The American Militia were badly trained, and far from
well disciplined, but they were brave, headstrong, and animated
by strong hatred of their old enemies the French.
Powerful as Louisbourg was (it was called the Dunkirk of
America) the Americans did not hesitate to attack it, and
they were justified by the result. On the 30th April, 1745,
the siege commenced; on the 15th June, M. Du Chambon,
the Governor of Louisbourg, signed the capitulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a year after this, the town was occupied by the
American Militia; but a garrison which included a company
of the Royal Artillery was then sent from England, and
remained until 1748, when by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
Louisbourg was restored to the French. The sum of 235,749<em>l.</em>
was paid by England to her American colonies, to meet the
expenses of the expedition whose success had now been cancelled
by diplomacy, and if to this sum be added the expenses
of the Navy, and the cost of garrisoning the place
for three years, we shall find that at least 600,000<em>l.</em> must
have been expended to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Time went on; treaties were torn up; and Louisbourg was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>again the object of English attack. It is this second siege
which is the one considered in this chapter; for none of the
Royal Artillery were present at the first; the Artillery
which fought on that occasion being militia, commanded by
an officer who fought against England during the subsequent
War of Independence. An indirect interest certainly is
attached to that siege in the mind of one studying the annals
of the Royal Artillery; for had it been unsuccessful, Annapolis
with its little garrison would have been exposed to
another assault. From private letters in possession of the descendants
of a distinguished Artillery officer—Major-General
Phillips—the perilous condition of that town during 1745
can be easily realized. Large bodies of French, and of
hostile Indians, were in the immediate neighbourhood,
making no secret of their intention to attack Annapolis in
force, should the English siege of Louisbourg be unsuccessful.
With the news of its capture, the danger to Annapolis
disappeared. These local wars between the French
and English settlers proved an admirable school for instructing
the New Englanders in military operations; nor was it
foreseen that the experience thus acquired would be turned
against the parent country. Distraction in America helped
England in her wars with France in Europe; and such distractions
were easy to raise among colonists whose mutual
hatred was so great. It was never imagined that the tools
which England thus used against France were being
sharpened in the process for use against herself in the stern
days which were coming on. Colonial rebellion seemed impossible;
colonial endurance was believed to be eternal; it
was hoped that patriotism and sentiment would be stronger
than any hardship, and would condone any injustice. But
when the day came when colonists asked the question
"Why?" for the Imperial actions towards them, the parental
tie was cut, and the lesson taught in the school of local warfare—the
lesson of their own strength—became apparent to
the children.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege of Louisbourg, in 1758, has a threefold interest
to the military reader; in connection with the conspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>services of the Royal Artillery on the occasion; in relation
to the story of the gallant Wolfe, who acted as one of the
Brigadiers; and in the fact that this was the last place held
by the French against England, on the east coast of America.
Ghastly for France as the results of the Seven Years' War
were, perhaps none were felt more acutely than this loss of
Canada, with its episodes of Louisbourg and Quebec. Louis
the Well-beloved was sinking into a decrepit debauchee;
and in the East and in the West his kingdom was crumbling
away. The distinctive characteristics, even at this day, of
the French population of Canada, which have survived more
than a century of English rule, give an idea of the firm hold
France had obtained on the country; and the strength of
that hold must have made the pang of defeat proportionately
bitter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Loudon was to have commanded the expedition; and
in 1757 the necessary troops and ships were concentrated at
Halifax, now the capital of Nova Scotia. But on learning
that there were 10,300 of a garrison in Louisbourg, besides
fifteen men-of-war and three frigates, he abandoned the
idea of an attack, and sailed for New York, leaving garrisons
in Halifax and Annapolis.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following year, the idea was revived; and General
Amherst left Halifax for Louisbourg with a force of 12,260
men, of whom 324 belonged to the Royal Artillery. The
naval force consisted of 23 ships of the line and 18 frigates;
and the number of vessels employed as transports was 144.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Artillery train included 2 Captain-Lieutenants, 6 First
Lieutenants, 5 Second Lieutenants, and 4 Lieutenant-Fireworkers;
besides a staff consisting of a Colonel, an Adjutant,
a Quartermaster, and two medical officers. There were no
less than 53 non-commissioned officers, to a total rank and
file of 63 gunners and 163 matrosses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Regiments engaged were as follows:—the 1st Royals,
15th, 17th, 22nd, 28th, 35th, 40th, 45th, 47th, 48th, 58th,
two battalions of the 60th Royal Americans, and Frazer's
Highlanders. There were eleven officers of miners and engineers,
and they were assisted during the siege, and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>demolition of the fortifications, by selected officers from
the Infantry Regiments. General Amherst was assisted by
the following Brigadiers:—Whitmore, Lawrance, and James
Wolfe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following guns were taken with the Artillery:—</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also two 8-inch and four 5½-inch howitzers.
Over 43,000 round shot, 2380 case, 41,762 shell, besides a
few grape and carcasses, and 4888 barrels of powder accompanied
the train.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fleet was commanded by Admiral Boscawen, assisted
by Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Hardy, and Commodore Durell.
It consisted, as has been said, of no less than 23 ships of
the line, and 18 frigates. Even the harbour of Halifax,
Nova Scotia, which has been the witness of so many historical
scenes, never saw a finer sight than when on Sunday
the 28th May, 1758, this fleet, accompanied by the transports,
sailed for Louisbourg. All the arrangements for the
embarkation and the siege had been made by Brigadier
Lawrance, at Halifax, even down to such details as the prescription
of ginger and sugar for the troops, for the purpose
of neutralizing the evil effects of the American water—an
evil which must certainly have existed in the Brigadier's
imagination. But just as they left the harbour, and reached
Sambro' Point, they met a vessel from England with General
Amherst on board, commissioned to take command of the
expedition, as far as the military forces were concerned.
The cordial relations between him and Admiral Boscawen
assisted, to a marked extent, in bringing about the success
of the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The orders issued to the troops were intended to excite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>them to anger against the enemy, at the same time that
they should inculcate the strongest discipline. The quaintness
of some of them renders them worthy of reproduction.
"No care or attention will be wanting for the subsistence
and preservation of the troops, such as our situation will
admit of. There will be an Hospital, and in time it is
hoped there will be fresh meat for the sick and wounded
men.... The least murmur or complaint against
any part of duty will be checked with great severity, and
any backwardness in sight of the enemy will be punished
with immediate death. If any man is villain enough to
desert his colours and go over to the enemy, he shall be
excepted in the capitulation, and hanged with infamy as a
traitor. When any of our troops are to attack the French
regular forces, they are to march close up to them, discharge
their pieces loaded with two bullets, and then rush
upon them with their bayonets; and the commander of the
Highlanders may, when he sees occasion, order his corps to
run upon them with their drawn swords.... A body
of light troops are now training to oppose the Indians,
Canadians, and other painted savages of the Island, who
will entertain them in their own way, and preserve the
women and children of the Army from their unnatural
barbarity. Indians spurred on by our inveterate enemy,
the French, are the only brutes and cowards in the creation
who were ever known to exercise their cruelties upon
the sex, and to scalp and mangle the poor sick soldiers
and defenceless women. When the light troops have by
practice and experience acquired as much caution and circumspection,
as they have spirit and activity, these howling
barbarians will fly before them.... The tents will
be slightly intrenched or palisaded, that the sentries may
not be exposed to the shot of a miserable-looking Mic-Mac,
whose trade is not war, but murder.... As the air of
Cape Breton is moist and foggy, there must be a particular
attention to the fire-arms upon duty, that they may be
kept dry, and always fit for use; and the Light Infantry
should fall upon some method to secure their arms from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the dews, and dropping of the trees when they are in
search of the enemy."</p>

<p class='c000'>After a favourable passage, the fleet anchored in Gabreuse
Bay, on Friday the 2nd June. This bay is about three
leagues by sea from Louisbourg harbour, and to the southwest
of it. Here it was resolved to attempt a landing; but
for days the elements fought for the French. Incessant
fogs and a tremendous surf rendered the enterprise hopeless,
until Thursday, the 8th June. The landing was ultimately
effected under the fire of the ships; the leading boats containing
the four senior companies of grenadiers, and all the
light infantry of the force, under General Wolfe, whose
courage and skill on this occasion were conspicuous. With
a loss of 111 killed and wounded, they succeeded in driving
the enemy back, and the other regiments were able to land.
A change of weather prevented the landing of Artillery,
baggage, and stores, so that the troops were exposed for the
night to great discomfort. The spirit of the men under
Wolfe on this occasion was remarkable. Boats were swamped,
or dashed to pieces on the rocks; many men were drowned;
and all had to leap into the water up to the waist; but
nothing could restrain their ardour. Not merely did they
drive the enemy back, but they captured 4 officers and
70 men, and 24 pieces of Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this day until the 19th, when the Royal Artillery
opened upon the town from a line of batteries which had
been thrown up along the shore, the operations of the army
were weary and monotonous in the extreme. With the exception
of Wolfe's party, which was detached to secure a
battery called the Lighthouse Battery,—an undertaking in
which he succeeded, the duties of the troops consisted in
making roads, and transporting from the landing-place guns,
ammunition, and stores. In all the arrangements for the
investment and bombardment, Colonel Williamson was warmly
supported by General Amherst; and the Admiral lent
his assistance by landing his marines to work with the
Artillery, and by sending four 32-pounders with part of his
own ship's company, for a battery whose construction had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>been strongly recommended. It was nearly ten o'clock on
the night of the 19th, when the English batteries opened
on the shipping and on the Island Battery. This last was a
powerful battery commanding the entrance to the harbour,
and with a double ditch to the land side to strengthen it.
It was the chief obstacle to the English movements, and
smart as our fire was, it returned it with equal warmth.
A battery of six 24-pounders was thrown up at the lighthouse
for the sole purpose of attempting to silence this
particular battery; and on the 25th it succeeded. The fire
on the rest of the fortifications of Louisbourg was marvellously
true, and incessant; and as of late years they had
been somewhat neglected, and in many places sea-sand had
been used with the mortar in their construction, the effect
of the English fire was more rapidly apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>One precaution had been taken on this occasion by the
French, which had been omitted by them in 1745, as they
had too good reason to remember. When compelled to
evacuate the Grand Battery, they set fire to it, and rendered
it utterly useless; so that the course pursued by the English
in the former siege, when they turned the guns of the
battery against the town, could not be repeated. The effects
of the English fire in the siege of 1758, when the Royal
Artillery was represented, were thus described by a French
officer who was in the town:—"Each cannon shot from the
English batteries shook and brought down immense pieces
of the ruinous walls, so that, in a short cannonade, the
Bastion du Roi, the Bastion Dauphin, and the courtin of
communication between them, were entirely demolished,
all the defences ruined, all the cannon dismounted, all the
parapets and banquettes razed, and became as one continued
breach to make an assault everywhere."<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An attempt was made by the Governor of Louisbourg to
procure a cessation of fire against a particular part of the
works, behind which he said was the hospital for the sick
and wounded. As however, there were shrewd reasons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>for believing that not the hospital, but the magazine, was
the subject of his anxious thoughts, his request was refused,
but he was informed that he might place his sick on
board ship, where they would be unmolested, or on the
island under our sentries. These offers, however, were not
accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fire of the enemy's Artillery slackened perceptibly
about the 13th July, and continued getting feebler, so that
in a fortnight's time an occasional shot was all that was
fired. At the commencement of the siege there were in
Louisbourg 218 pieces of ordnance, exclusive of 11 mortars;
but such was the effect of the English fire, not merely in
dismounting and disabling the guns, but (as the deserters
reported) in killing and wounding the gunners, that some
days before the 27th July, when the capitulation was signed,
the French reply to our Artillery fire was simply <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nil</span></i>. The
gallantry of the French commandant, the Chevalier de
Drucour, was undoubted; but he was sorely tried by the
fears and prayers of the unhappy civil population, to whom
military glory was a myth, but a bombardment a very painful
reality. Madame de Drucour did all in her power to
inspire the troops with increased ardour; while there were
any guns in position to fire, she daily fired three herself;
and showed a courage which earned for her the respect both
of friend and enemy. But misfortunes came fast upon one
another. A shot from the English batteries striking an iron
bolt in the powder magazine of the French ship 'Entreprenant,'
an explosion followed, which set fire to her, and to
two others alongside, the 'Capricieuse' and 'Superbe.' The
confusion which ensued baffles description; and not the least
startling occurrence was the self-discharge of the heated
guns in the burning ships, whose shot went into the town,
and occasionally into the other two men-of-war which had
escaped a similar fate to that which befell the three which
have been named. Four days later, on the 25th July, a
party of 600 British sailors entered the harbour, boarded the
only two ships which remained, the 'Prudent' and 'Bienfaisant,'
set fire to the former, which had gone aground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and towed the latter out of the harbour to the English
fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their batteries being destroyed, the fortifications one vast
breach, their ships of war burnt or captured, and there being
no prospect of relief, the French commander had no alternative
but capitulation. He first proposed to treat, but was
informed in reply, that unless he capitulated in an hour the
English fleet would enter the harbour and bombard the
town. So, after a little delay, he consented, on condition
that the French troops should be sent as prisoners of war to
France.</p>

<p class='c000'>The articles of capitulation were signed on the 27th July,
1758, and immediately three companies of grenadiers took
possession of the West Gate, while General Whitmore superintended
the disarming of the garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expenditure of ammunition by the Royal Artillery
during the siege was as follows:—13,700 round shot, 3340
shell, 766 case shot, 156 round shot fixed, 50 carcasses, and
1493 barrels of powder. Eight brass, and five iron guns
were disabled; and one mortar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the English army, 524 were killed or wounded; and at
the capture of the place, there were 10,813 left fit for duty.
The total strength of the French garrison, including sailors
and marines on shore, at the same date, was 5637 of all ranks,
of whom 1790 were sick or wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the capitulation many of the English men-of-war
moved into the harbour; and the demolition of the fortifications
by the Engineers and working-parties was methodically
commenced. The approach of the winter, and the heavy
garrison duties, suspended the work for a time; and it was
not until the 1st June, 1760, that the uninterrupted destruction
of the works was commenced, under Captain Muckell
of the Company of Miners, assisted by working parties from
the infantry, of strength varying according to the work,
from 160 to 220 daily. The miners and artificers numbered
a little over 100. The whole work was completed on the
10th November, 1760, there having been only two days'
intermission, besides Sundays, one being the King's birthday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and the other being Midsummer Day. The reason for keeping
this latter day is thus mentioned in a MS. diary of the
mining operations at Louisbourg, now in the Royal Artillery
Record Office, which belonged to Sir John Ligonier:—"According
to tradition among the miners, Midsummer was
the first that found out the copper mines in Cornwall, for
which occasion they esteem this a holy day, and all the
miners come from below ground to carouse, and drink to
the good old man's memory."</p>

<p class='c000'>The fortifications of Louisbourg have never been rebuilt;
and with the disappearance of its garrison its importance
vanished. Cape Breton and the Island of St. John, now
called Prince Edward's Island, fell into English hands
almost immediately, and have never since been ruled by
any other. The former is now part of Nova Scotia; its
capital is no longer Louisbourg, but Sydney; and its French
population has vanished—being replaced, to a great extent,
by Highlanders from Scotland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the purpose of this work has made the Artillery
part of the army's duties the most prominent in the chapter,
it cannot be denied that, to the ordinary reader, Wolfe is
the centre of attraction. The time was drawing near when the
brave spirit which animated him at Louisbourg was to fire
his exhausted and weary frame, and raise him from his sickbed
to that encounter on the Plains of Abraham, which his
own death and that of his opponent were to render famous
for all time. And the fire which then breathed life for the
moment into his own frame inspired the men under his
command at Louisbourg. The foremost duties, the posts of
danger, were always his; and with such a guide his followers
never failed. On one evening in June he was issuing orders
to his division, which was to be employed during the night in
bringing up guns to a new and exposed post. It was necessary
to warn the men that the fire of the enemy would be
probably warmer than usual, to check the working-parties:
but with simple confidence, he said, "He does not doubt but
that the officers and soldiers will co-operate with their
usual spirit, that they may have at least their share in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>"honours of this enterprise." Of a truth, he who asks his
men to do nothing that he will not do himself,—who trusts
them, instead of worrying and doubting them,—and who
holds before his own eyes and theirs that ideal of duty which
is of all virtues the most God-like, is the man to <em>lead</em> men;
and such a man was Wolfe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louisbourg and Quebec—two words—yet on Wolfe's grave
they would mean pages of heroism.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Certain</span> Goths and Vandals, connected with the Board
of Ordnance in 1799, issued an order granting permission
for the destruction of many old documents which
had accumulated in the Battalion offices at Woolwich since
the year 1758. Had these been vouchers for pecuniary outlay,
it is but just to the Honourable Board to say that this
permission would never have been granted. But as they
referred merely to such trumpery matters as expenditure of
life, and the stories of England's military operations, no
reluctance was displayed, nor any trouble taken to distinguish
between what might have proved useful, and useless to posterity.
A gap consequently occurs in the official records of
the 1st and 2nd Battalions, which increases twentyfold the
labours of the student.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Battle of Minden was fought during the years represented
by that gap, and the difficulties to be overcome in
tracing the identical companies of the Royal Artillery which
were engaged can only be realised by the reader, who has
himself had to burrow among old records and mutilated
volumes. The main purpose in this history being to
strengthen the <em>Battery</em> as well as the <em>Regimental <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></em>, it was
of the utmost importance that the Companies, which did so
much to decide the contest on that eventful day, should be
discovered with certainty, for the sake of the existing Batteries
who are entitled to their glory, by virtue of succession;
and—to make certain that no hasty conclusions have been
arrived at—it has been thought desirable to give the data on
which they have been based.</p>

<p class='c000'>Minden was fought in 1759. Fortunately, a fresh distribution
of the companies in the two existing Battalions took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>place in the preceding year; and the names of the officers
in each company are given at length in Cleaveland's MS.
notes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now three companies are known to have been present at
Minden. Of one, Captain Phillips', there is fortunately no
doubt. It was then No. 5 Company of the 1st Battalion;
and after long and glorious service became on the 1st July,
1859, No. 7 Battery, 14th Brigade, when that change in the
nomenclature of the companies took place, which is always
baffling the student. On the 1st January, 1860, the exigencies
of the service required yet another christening, and
it became, on transfer, No. 4 Battery of the 13th Brigade,
which it now is. This Battery was undoubtedly present at
Minden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tracing of the other two companies is not so easy. It
is on record that one was commanded by Captain Cleaveland.
In 1758, this officer was in command of No. 2 Company of
the 2nd Battalion, but in the winter of that year he exchanged
with Captain Tovey, of the 1st Battalion, and
almost immediately marched with his new company to join
the Allied Armies on the Continent. This was then No. 4
Company of the 1st Battalion; and as Captain Cleaveland
exchanged into it on the 30th October, 1758, and was in
Germany with his Company in the beginning of December,
(no second exchange having taken place,) there can be little
doubt that another of the Companies at Minden was No. 4
Company of the 1st Battalion, now designated No. 3 Battery
of the 5th Brigade.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judging from a mention of Captain Drummond in one of
Prince Ferdinand's despatches, the third company present at
the battle would at first sight appear to have been No. 6
of the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Captain Thomas
Smith,—Captain Drummond being at that date his Captain-Lieutenant.
But there is no mention of Captain Smith in
any of the despatches; and as there is a very frequent and
most honourable mention of Captain Forbes Macbean, who
was undoubtedly present in command of one of the companies,
it would appear that Captain-Lieutenant Drummond must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>have been transferred to some other company for this service.
Fortunately the Records of the 1st Battalion—generally a
wilderness at this time—contain a key to the solution of the
difficulty, for they show that Captain Forbes Macbean (on
his promotion on 1st January, 1759, the very year that
Minden was fought) took command of No. 8 Company of
the 1st Battalion, now A Battery, 11th Brigade. As
he never exchanged, and is specially mentioned as having
<em>taken his company</em> to Germany, this may be assumed with
certainty to have been the third of the companies present at
Minden.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little confusion has been caused by the mention of
Captain Foy in Prince Ferdinand's General Order after the
battle; and one writer, generally marvellously accurate,
assumes that he commanded one of the companies engaged.
But, in the first place, he was then merely a Captain-Lieutenant,
and much junior even to Captain Drummond, and, in
the second, he was then holding a special appointment,
namely, that of Bridge-master to the Artillery. Although
he and Captain Drummond had undoubtedly each charge of
some guns during the battle, he was certainly not there with
his Company. Indeed, in a contemporary notice, we find
that this officer proceeded <em>alone</em> to join the Allied Army in
the capacity named above. He held a similar appointment
in America afterwards for nine years, and died in that
country in 1779.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two most prominent of the Artillery officers present
at Minden were Captain Phillips, who commanded, and
Captain Macbean; and both deserve more than passing notice.
The former joined the Regiment as a cadet gunner in 1746,
became Lieutenant-Fireworker in the following year, Second
Lieutenant in 1755, and First Lieutenant in 1756. When
holding this rank, he was appointed to the command of a
company of miners raised in 1756 for duty in Minorca, but
no longer required after the capitulation of Port Mahon.
Instead of disbanding them, however, the Board of Ordnance
converted them into a company of Artillery, and added them
to the Regiment. Greatly to the indignation of the officers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of a corps, whose promotion then, as now, was by seniority,
Lieutenant Phillips was transferred with the company, as a
Captain, without having passed through the intermediate
grade of Captain-Lieutenant. If the end ever justifies the
means, this job on the part of Sir John Ligonier, then
Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was justified by Captain
Phillips' subsequent career both in Germany and in America.
A minor point in connection with this officer is worthy of
mention. He was the first to originate a band in the Royal
Artillery—not a permanent one, however—the present Band
only dating as far back as 1771, when the 4th Battalion was
formed, and with it the nucleus of what has developed into
probably the best military band in the world. Captain
Phillips died—a general officer—in Virginia, in the year
1781, from illness contracted on active service.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forbes Macbean, the next most worthy of mention, began
his career in the Regiment, as a Cadet Matross, and died in
1800 as Colonel-Commandant of the Invalid Battalion. He
was present at Fontenoy, as has already been mentioned; in
Germany during the campaign of which Minden was part;
in Portugal, where he reached the rank of Inspector-General
of the Portuguese Artillery; and in Canada, in the years
1778-9, as commanding the Royal Artillery. He is mentioned
in Kane's List, as having been the second officer in
the Regiment who obtained the blue ribbon of Science, the
Fellowship of the Royal Society—an honour borne by a good
many in the Regiment now, and valued by every one who
appreciates its position as a scientific corps.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle of Minden was the first during the operations
in Germany of the Allied Army under Prince Ferdinand of
Brunswick, at which special notice was made of the English
troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>These operations commenced in 1757, the year in which
Prince Ferdinand assumed the command of the Allied Army,
and terminated in 1762. On the 8th March, 1758, Prince
Ferdinand captured Minden from the French—a town
situated on the river Weser, about 45 miles W.S.W. from
Hanover; and retained possession of it until July, 1759,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>when it was retaken from General Zastrow and his Hessian
troops by the French under M. de Broglio.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this interval, however, the Allied Army had been
strengthened by the arrival of the following Regiments from
England, sent by King George, as Elector of Brunswick-Luneberg,
viz., <em>Cavalry</em>: Horse Guards Blue, Bland's,
Howard's, Inniskillen, and Mordaunt's. <em>Infantry</em>: Napier's,
Kingsley's, Welsh Fusiliers, Home's, and Stuart's.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were afterwards joined by the North British
Dragoons, and Brudenel's Regiment of Foot. The Artillery
which first accompanied this force consisted of a Captain,
six subalterns, and 120 non-commissioned officers and men,
but in 1759 it was reinforced to a total strength of three
companies. At first nothing but light 6-pounders had come,
for use as battalion guns, and had this state of matters
remained unaltered, this chapter need never have been
written. But with the reinforcements of 1759 came also
twenty-eight guns of heavier calibre, and the Artillery was
now divided into independent Brigades or Batteries, with
a proportion merely of battalion guns; and as it now
ceased to march in one column, as had formerly been the
case, the great kettledrums were no longer carried with
the companies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July, 1759, the French re-occupied Minden; and, outside
the town, Prince Ferdinand was encamped with his
Army, the right resting on Minden Marsh, the left on the
Weser, but on a somewhat extended arc, and with intervals so
great as to appear dangerous. He resolved to make a stand
against the French, who had been considerably strengthened
and were now under the command of M. de Contades. The
French Commander had obtained permission from Paris to
attack the Allies, and on the evening of the 31st July he
issued the most detailed orders to his army as to the hours
of movement, disposition of the troops, and order of battle.
Prince Ferdinand anticipating the movements of the French,
had issued orders for his army to march at 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the
morning of the 1st August, moving in eight columns towards
Minden, thus narrowing the arc on which they would deploy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and proportionately diminishing the intervals. By the hour
the Allies marched, the French, who had moved two hours
before, were drawn up in order of battle, and at 6.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
the Allied Army was similarly formed. The appearance of
the armies now was that of the arcs of two concentric circles,
Minden being the centre, and the French Army being on
the inner and smaller arc. The French had confidence in
superior numbers—in the protection of the guns of the
fortress in case of retreat—and in the prestige of recent
successes. Their commander had boasted of his intention
of surrounding Prince Ferdinand's army, and sending their
capitulation to Paris. His plan was to make a powerful
attack on General Wangenheim's corps, the left of the Allied
Army, and somewhat detached from the main body; which
he hoped to turn. But, as the event turned out, Wangenheim's
division did not change its position during the whole
engagement. About 7 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> a French battery commenced
harassing the English Artillery, as it advanced in column of
route on right of the Allied infantry; but as soon as possible
Captain Macbean brought his battery—known as the heavy
brigade—into action, and soon silenced the enemy's fire.
Although he had only ten medium 12-pounders, manned by
his own and Captain Phillips's companies—and two of these
were disabled during this Artillery duel—he succeeded in
overcoming a battery of thirty guns. While he was thus
engaged, the celebrated attack of the British infantry on the
French cavalry was taking place. The British, accompanied
by the Hanoverian Guards, and Hardenberg's Regiment,
marched for some 150 paces, exposed both to a cross fire
from the enemy's batteries, and a musketry fire from the
infantry; but, notwithstanding their consequent losses, and
their continued exposure on both flanks, so unshaken were
they, and so courageously did they fight, that in a very short
time the French cavalry was routed. It is doubtful if their
gallantry has ever been exceeded. Captain Macbean, being
now at leisure, advanced his battery, came into action to
the left, and—first preventing the French cavalry from
reforming—followed by opening fire upon the Saxon troops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>who were now attacking the British infantry. The value of
this assistance was very great.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the left of the Allies, the Artillery fire was equally
successful, and the Hanoverians and Hessians greatly distinguished
themselves. Notwithstanding the unhappy and
severely expiated blunder of Lord George Sackville, in failing
to obey the orders for advancing his cavalry, before 10 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
the French army fled in confusion. At this time, Prince
Ferdinand advanced the English guns on the right, as close
to the morass as they could be taken, to prevent the French
from returning to their old camp on the Minden side of
Dutzen; and in this he completely succeeded,—the enemy
being compelled to retire behind the high ground, with their
right on the Weser. The victorious army encamped on the
field of battle, and on totalling their losses, they were found
to amount to 2800 killed and wounded, 1394 of that number
being British. The French lost in killed, wounded, and
prisoners, between 7000 and 8000; besides 43 cannon, 10
pairs of colours, and 7 standards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Royal Artillery had present on this memorable day
in addition to Captain Macbean's heavy brigade, two light
12-pounders, three light 6-pounders, and four howitzers,
under Captain-Lieutenant Drummond; and four light 12-pounders,
three light 6-pounders, and two howitzers, under
Captain-Lieutenant Foy. There were also twelve light
6-pounders with six British battalions. Captain Phillips
commanded the whole three companies at the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two points which strike one most after the perusal of
the accounts of this engagement are the stolidity and nerve
of English infantry under fire, and the advantage of independent
action on the part of Field Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Minden was a cruel blow at the system of battalion guns.
And although battalion guns have long disappeared, the
mere concentration of them into batteries was not enough,
while those batteries had to accommodate their movements
to those of the battalions to which they were attached.
Billed ordnance—with a range double that of the infantry
weapon—had been in existence for years; and yet general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>officers at reviews and field-days made the batteries keep
with the battalions;—advancing, retiring, dressing together,
as if the only advantage of a gun over a rifle was the size
of the projectile, and not also increased range. It seemed
never to dawn upon their understanding that by bringing
their Artillery within range of the enemy's infantry fire, as
by their system they certainly did, they would ensure for
their batteries, after half an hour's engagement, a ghastly
paraphernalia of dead horses and empty saddles. It was
not until the year 1871, that an order was issued by one who
is at once Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Colonel of
the Royal Artillery, giving to field batteries in the field that
inestimable boon, comparative freedom of action. The lesson
was a long time in learning; and one of the best teachers
was one of the oldest—this very Battle of Minden—which,
in the words of one who took part in it, was of such importance
in its results, that it "entirely defeated the French
views, disconcerted all their schemes, and rescued Hanover,
Brunswick, and Hesse from the rapacious hands of a cruel
ambitious, and elated enemy."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the day after the battle, Prince Ferdinand issued a
General Order, thanking the army for their gallantry, and
particularizing, among others, "the three English Captains,
Phillips, Drummond, and Foy;" and on discovering that
he had omitted mention of Captain Macbean, he wrote the
following letter to him in his own hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>"<em>To</em> Captain <span class='sc'>Macbean</span>, <em>of the British Artillery.</em></p>

<p class='c014'>"<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—It is from a sense of your merit, and a regard to
justice, that I do in this manner declare I have reason
to be infinitely satisfied with your behaviour, activity, and
zeal, which in so conspicuous a manner you made appear
at the battle of Thonhausen, on the 1st of August. The
talents you possess in your profession did not a little contribute
to render our fire superior to that of the enemy,
and it is to you and your Brigade that I am indebted for
having silenced the fire of a battery of the enemy, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>extremely galled the troops, and particularly the British
infantry.</p>

<p class='c014'>"Accept then, sir, from me the just tribute of my most
perfect acknowledgment, accompanied by my most sincere
thanks. I shall be happy in every opportunity of obliging
you, desiring only occasions of proving it; being with the
most distinguished esteem,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in22'>"Duke of Brunswic and Luneberg."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Subsequently, as a further proof of his appreciation of the
services of the Royal Artillery at Minden or Thonhausen, as
the battle was also named, the Prince directed the following
gratuities to be presented to the senior officers:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of the remaining operations of the Allied Army,
in so far as they bear upon the services of the Royal Artillery,
may be briefly stated. In 1760, two additional companies
were sent to Germany, the Regiment having in the
interim been augmented by a third battalion. The British
guns now with the army were as follows:—eight heavy,
twelve medium, and six light 12-pounders; thirty light
6-pounders; three 8-inch, and six Royal mortars. Before
the end of the war the armament was changed to eight
heavy, six medium, and four light 12-pounders; twenty-four
heavy, and thirty-four light 6-pounders; eight 8-inch, and
four Royal howitzers. Captain Macbean is the prominent
Artillery officer during the rest of the campaign: except,
perhaps, at Warberg, where, on the 30th July, 1760, Captain
Phillips astounded every one by bringing up the Artillery at
a gallop, and so seconding the attack as utterly to prevent
the enemy, who had passed the Dymel, from forming on the
other side; and by the accuracy and rapidity of his fire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>converting their retreat into a precipitate rout. Perhaps it
was young blood that prompted this unexpected action; for,
as has already been stated, he was but a boy compared with
most captains; if so, it contributes somewhat to atone for
Sir John Ligonier's favouritism. More than thirty years
were to pass before Horse Artillery should form part of the
British army, and show what mobility it was possible to
attain; and more than a century ere Field Artillery should
reach the perfection it now possesses, a perfection which
treads closely on the heels of the more brilliant branch.
During the Seven Years' War, so unwieldy was the movement
of Artillery in the field, that this little episode, which
makes modern lips smile, was thought worthy of a record
denied to events which would now be considered far more
important.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although more than two years passed between the Battle
of Minden and the conclusion of peace, the custom which
then prevailed of armies going into winter-quarters curtailed
the time for active operations; and even when the forces
were manœuvring, much of the time was spent in empty
marching and counter-marching. At Warberg, as at Minden,
the heaviest loss fell upon the English troops, of whom 590
were killed or wounded; their gallantry—more especially in
the case of the Highlanders and grenadiers—being again
conspicuous. Among the trophies taken on this occasion
from the enemy were ten guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fortune of war changed repeatedly; and the British
troops received further reinforcements, including three battalions
of the Guards. Lord George Sackville having been
cashiered was succeeded in the command of the English
contingent by the Marquis of Granby; and a cheerful feeling
prevailed among the troops, since the news had arrived of
the conquest of Canada.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 12th February, 1761, Captain Macbean received
the brevet rank of Major, and was ordered to proceed with
a brigade of eight heavy 12-pounders, to join the Hereditary
Prince near Fritzlar, on the following day. This town was
garrisoned by 1200 French troops under M. de Narbonne; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Major Macbean—having been entrusted with the command
of the whole Artillery of the Prince's army—commenced
the bombardment on the 14th, placing his batteries within
300 yards of the wall, and advancing some light pieces even
nearer, to scour the parapet with grape. As, however, he
had no guns heavier than 12-pounders, and the walls were
made of flint, his fire, although hot and steady, made little
or no impression; nor could he do much damage to the gates,
which were barricaded with felled trees, and immense heaps
of earth and stones.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hereditary Prince, although expressing himself pleased
with Major Macbean's dispositions, was evidently impatient
to take the city; so Major Macbean suggested shelling it
with howitzers, a suggestion which was approved of. So
successful was the fire, that in about an hour's time the
enemy capitulated, being allowed to march out with the
honours of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Major Macbean received the Prince's special thanks; and
the town was ordered to pay him 4000 crowns in lieu of their
bells, a perquisite in those days of the commanding officer of
Artillery, when a siege was crowned with success.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this time, matters looked well for the Allies. On
the 25th June, 1761, news reached the army of the reduction
of Belleisle; and in October, 1762, tidings of the
British successes at the Havannah arrived. On both occasions,
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joie</span></i> was fired. On the 1st November, 1762,
Cassel capitulated; a signal victory was gained over the
combined Austrians and Imperialists, near Freytag, by Prince
Henry of Prussia, which filled the Allied camp with joy; and
on the 14th November, word reached the army that the
preliminaries of peace had been signed at Fontainebleau.
On the 24th December, Prince Ferdinand wrote to King
George, congratulating him on the peace, and asking permission
to quit the army, where his presence was no longer
necessary; and at the same time he announced to the British
troops, that the remembrance of their gallantry would not
cease but with his life; and that "by the skill of their
officers he had been enabled at the same time to serve his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>country, and to make a suitable return for the confidence
which His Britannic Majesty had been pleased to honour
him with."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 13th January, 1763, the thanks of the House of
Commons was conveyed to the British troops for "their
meritorious and eminent services;" and on the 25th
January, their homeward march through Holland commenced;
through the provinces of Guelderland, Nimeguen,
and Breda, to Williamstadt, where they took ship for
England.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, as sleep on the eyes of the weary, so peace descended
for a time on those towns and hamlets by the Weser and the
Rhine, which had been for so many years unwilling pawns
on the great chess-board of war.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Third Battalion.—The History and Present Designation<br /> of the Companies.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Not</span> very long after the Battle of Minden, and while the
lessons of the war were urging on the military world
the increasing importance of Artillery, the Board of Ordnance
resolved to increase the Royal Artillery still further.
This was done by transferring five companies from the
existing battalions, and by raising five others; the ten being
combined into the Third Battalion with a staff similar to
that of the other two. Each company of the battalion consisted
of a Captain, a Captain-Lieutenant, a First and Second
Lieutenant, 3 Lieutenant-Fireworkers, 3 sergeants, 3 corporals,
8 bombardiers, 20 gunners, 62 matrosses, and 2
drummers; making a total of 105 per company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The total of all ranks, on the formation of the battalion,
was 1054. At the end of the Seven Years' War, the battalion
was reduced to 554; but as the troubles in America
became visible, it was again increased; and in 1779, the
establishment of all ranks stood at 1145. At the peace of
1783, it fell to 648; rising, however, in 1793, during England's
continental troubles, to 1240. It reached its maximum
during the Peninsular War, when its strength was no less
than 1461 of all ranks. In the year 1778, when the 4th
Battalion was raised, two companies were taken from the
3rd; but they were replaced in 1779.</p>

<p class='c000'>For thirty years after the reductions made in 1816, the
average strength of the battalion was 700; but from that
time it gradually rose until, at the commencement of the
war with Russia, it stood at 1128, and in the following year
it reached 1220.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a little obscurity as to the services of this battalion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>during the American War of Independence. One set
of documents claims for Nos. 1 and 6 Companies, no inconsiderable
share in the earlier part of the campaign; another
asserts that to the 4th Battalion alone does all the credit,
which the Artillery during that war especially merited,
belong. The truth seems to be, that, in 1778, two companies
of the 3rd Battalion were in America, and were
engaged in several battles; but that in 1779, the men of
these companies were drafted into those of the 4th Battalion,
and their officers returned to England.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fusion was not, however, complete; for we find traces
of No. 1 Company of the 3rd Battalion in America so late as
1781, when a detachment of it was present at Guildford
Court-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>No fewer than seven companies of the battalion were
engaged in the West Indies in the last decade of the
eighteenth century; five companies served in the Peninsula,
four being present at the Battle of Corunna; eight companies
served on the Walcheren expedition; and four
companies—Nos. 2, 4, 7, 9—were present at the Battle
of Waterloo. At this battle detachments of Nos. 5 and 6
Companies were also present.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the commencement of the Crimean war, although the
strength of the battalion was considerable, it only consisted
of eight companies, two having been reduced in 1819; and
of these eight, no fewer than six took part in the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Appended is a list—as in the case of the 1st and 2nd
Battalions—showing, in anticipation, the various military
operations in which the companies of the 3rd Battalion were
engaged—the succession of Captains, as far as can be traced
down to 1859—and the nomenclature introduced in that
year, when Battalions and Companies became Brigades and
Batteries.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Siege of Belleisle.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Although</span> the History of the Royal Artillery is the
history of England's campaigns since the existence of
the Regiment, there are occasional chapters in these wars
more interesting to the Artilleryman, than to the ordinary
military student, or the general reader. There have been
events which have had no perceptible effect on the progress
of the campaigns, and yet are indissolubly woven in our
Regimental annals. Of such events the siege of Belleisle is
a type.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the Seven Years' War, England made various diversions—in
addition to those in America and the East
Indies—to distract the French in their operations against
the Allied Army in Germany. One of these was the attack
on the Island of Belleisle on the west coast of France, between
Port Louis and the mouth of the Loire. It was devised
in the hope of inducing the French to detach some of their
forces from Germany, for the defence of their own coasts;
but in this respect it failed. Another motive, which inspired
the English Government, was that they might gratify the
lust for conquest, which at that time animated the people,
whetted instead of satiated by their successes in the East
and in the West.</p>

<p class='c000'>To a certain extent, it succeeded in this; but after counting
the cost of the victory, it required the most exaggerated
statements on the part of the Ministry to reconcile the
nation to the expenditure of life and money caused by
the Siege of Belleisle, if indeed it can be said ever to have
been reconciled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The English nation has characteristics, which are displayed
at every stage of its history. Lavish during war in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>order to gain its ends, it is disposed to be penurious during
peace; and the favourite stalking-horse to power then is a
profession of economy. The whole of Europe stood amazed
at the readiness with which the English nation granted
enormous supplies for the carrying on of the war ending in
1762; and this had perhaps as much effect as military success
in persuading the French to consent to the disastrous
conditions of the Peace of Paris. It may be said that, as a
nation, the English sink political differences during war, and
show a union almost peculiar to themselves. The only case
in which war and political differences existed simultaneously
to any great extent was during the American War of Independence;
the reasons then were exceptional, and the result
fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a consequence of political union, comes a demand for
vigorous administration; and the success of Mr. Pitt's ministry
was due to his knowledge of this. The Siege of Belleisle
was an illustration of this knowledge. It cannot be said
that in time of peace the English insist on such administrative
vigour; in fact, vigorous action in the head of a department
is viewed with distrust and suspicion more frequently
than with admiration. It is by remembering considerations
such as these that a military operation such as is now to be
described can be understood, almost valueless in its political
results, expensive in its conduct, and—in a military point of
view—worthless, save in so far as it strengthened (as only
success can do) the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i> and courage of the Army.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to the Artilleryman this siege has an interest far
above political considerations; it was one of the earliest
schools for developing that which is the most scientific,
albeit less brilliant branch of the Regiment,—Siege Artillery.
And it was suitable that the man who commanded the siege-train
on this occasion should be one eminent afterwards in
the scientific as well as the military world: a Fellow of the
Royal Society as well as a practical soldier: a fit predecessor
to the many who have since distinguished the Regiment by
their learning—Brigadier Desaguliers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Artillery present at the siege consisted of two companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>from Portsmouth, Captain Tovey's and Captain Hind's,
with about seventy miners; besides eleven detachments for
battalion guns, and others for service on board the bomb-vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were no less than thirty-seven Artillery officers employed
in the expedition. Of these, Captain-Lieutenant
Muckell was killed, and the following were wounded: Brigadier
Desaguliers, Lieutenant N. Kindersley,—the Acting
Adjutant, Lieutenant E. Williams, and Lieutenant-Fireworker
A. McKenzie. The following is a list of the officers
who did duty in the trenches, in addition to those named
above:—</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also two medical officers attached to the Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>When, in the early part of 1761, preparations for an expedition
on a large scale were commenced at Portsmouth, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>was imagined that the destination of the fleet was either the
East or West Indies. The vessels were provisioned for
twelve months; there were no less than 35 transports; and
the only difficulty that spectators and gossips had to overcome
was the fact that an immense number of flat-bottomed
boats, capable each of carrying 60 men, was to form part of
the fleet. Those were days when newspaper reporters and
interviewers were not licensed as now; and when inquisitive
members of Parliament had to content themselves with very
evasive replies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to a powerful fleet and Artillery, no less than
fifteen battalions of infantry and three troops of Burgoyne's
horse accompanied the expedition. The command of the
troops was given to Major-General Studholm Hodgson, with
several Brigadiers to assist him, some of whom bore names
which we shall meet again during the War of Independence,
Howe, Burgoyne, and Carleton. The fleet was under the
command of Commodore Keppel; and it was intended that
much of the work should be done by it, as the nation had of
late been somewhat outspoken as to the inaction of the navy,
nor were Admiral Byng and Minorca forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the fleet first sailed from Portsmouth on the 29th
March, 1761, Captain Tovey commanded the Artillery; but
on the 5th April Colonel Desaguliers was ordered by the King
to proceed (with the rank of Brigadier) to Portsmouth: the
miners were ordered to the same place to join Captain Hind's
company; the whole to proceed without delay to Belleisle,
whither it was now known the expedition had gone. The
gallant Brigadier was no sluggard; at midnight on the 6th
April—those were not the days of railways—he reached
Portsmouth, sent word to Captain Hind to have his company
ready at a moment's notice, went himself on board the
'Blast' transport on the afternoon of the 7th, and sailed at
daybreak the following morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same energy displayed itself on his reaching Belleisle.
The expedition had already met with misfortune. An attempt
had been made on the 8th April to land 300 men on the
south-east of the island, after a heavy and apparently successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>bombardment from the fleet; but the enemy charged
them with superior numbers before they could form, and
took them all prisoners, besides inflicting a loss on some
detachments which landed to assist them, of 37 killed and
76 wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>A heavy gale followed, in which 20 boats were lost and
many vessels driven to sea; the introduction to a continuation
of frightful weather which lasted during the whole siege.
On the 12th April, Brigadier Desaguliers arrived; learnt
what had taken place; immediately ordered the battalion
guns to be placed in the Ordnance boats,—ready to accompany
the troops on the next attempt at a landing, coming into
action so as to enable the infantry to form up on the shore;
got his warrant as commanding the Royal Artillery published
in orders; appointed Captain-Lieutenant Stehelin his Brigade
Major; and volunteered to reconnoitre the island for a landing-place.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 22nd, Captain Hind's company, with the miners,
some other troops, and an immense quantity of Artillery
stores, reached Belleisle. It had by this time been resolved
to attempt a landing near the place, where the first had
failed; but with a view to deceiving the enemy, the newly-arrived
troops were ordered to get into the ship's boats, and
make a feint of landing at the Point of Sauzon. The feint
succeeded; the fear of their landing detained a large body
of the enemy whose presence would have been invaluable in
checking the real landing, which was now effected, under
cover of the fire from the fleet, and assisted by the panic
which was created among the enemy by the appearance on
their flank of a number of men who had climbed up some
difficult precipices, at a little distance from the spot where
the main body landed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to a body of 900 marines, which landed with
the other troops, the Commodore collected 500 from the
ships, and landed them; and as the Colonel of the Marines,
McKenzie, had been wounded, the command of this large body
devolved upon a Captain named Collins, who on account of
the responsibility of his position received the rank of Major.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>For some days the weather was so tempestuous that it was
impossible to land the heavy guns, or Artillery stores; and
the enemy was enabled to strengthen his position unmolested.
The bomb-vessels stood close in to the shore, and plied the
Citadel, but without much effect. Picquets of 500 men were
on duty every night in the English camp; the inhabitants
of Palais, the capital of the Island, were strictly watched;
and a village in a good position was taken and set fire to,
from which circumstance it was always after this time called
"the Burnt Village." The Artillerymen were hard at work
making their batteries and parallels, assisted by large
working parties from the Line; and every officer in the Army
who knew anything of engineering was invited to submit his
name with a view to employment at an increased rate of pay.
The trench work was not a favourite duty with the infantry,
even after working-pay was allowed for it; and Brigadier
Desaguliers had to make the strongest representations on
the subject to General Hodgson. The men did not dislike
idling and loafing about the trenches; it was the spade-work
which was unpopular; and this led to an amusing order
being issued, that any Artillery officer who found a man
near his post, idling or curious, was to "lay hold of him,
and make him work for 12 hours."</p>

<p class='c000'>The town of Palais was soon occupied by the English
troops, and being near the Citadel, to which the enemy had
withdrawn, it afforded excellent cover for the English marksmen,
whom the reluctance of the enemy to fire on the town
left quite unmolested.</p>

<p class='c000'>The armament for the batteries had at length been landed
and mounted, although not without the greatest difficulty.
The Brigadier had at this time, and later on, repeatedly to
acknowledge the assistance he received from the Navy, between
which and the Artillery there was then, as now, a
strong <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now commenced the regular siege:—Sebastopol in
miniature; daily and nightly bombardments; the trenches
flooded with rain; and Artillerymen so reduced in numbers
as to be without the requisite rest or relief. Three important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>batteries were opened against the Citadel, known respectively
as the 16-Gun, the 10-Gun, and the 4-Gun Batteries.
Mortar batteries were made, as the siege progressed, containing
two 13-inch, three 10-inch, and six 8-inch land-service
mortars; two 13-inch, and two 10-inch sea-service
mortars; besides fifteen Royal mortars, and ten Coe-horn's.
The guns in the batteries were heavy 24-pounders, medium
12-pounders, and 8-inch and 4½-inch howitzers. There were
a few 3-pounder guns, and the Battalion guns, which were
6-pounders. Although it is somewhat anticipating matters,
it may here be mentioned that the expenditure of ammunition
by the Artillery during the siege amounted to 1500
barrels of powder, 17,000 shot, and 12,000 shell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The infantry had been divided into three brigades, with a
total of all ranks of 6254, exclusive of Artillery, Marines,
and Burgoyne's horse, the last-named being chiefly employed
in duties of transport and foraging. The duties, which were
very heavy, were taken alternately by brigades. The marines
did duty <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">in corps</span></i>, and had to find 378 men for various guards
every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Palais was taken, the bells of the churches became,
according to custom, the property of the commanding officer
of Artillery. A piteous letter, however, was written to him
by the priests, pleading the poverty of their parishes, the
destitution of many members of their congregations, and
the precarious livelihood earned by the most fortunate, concluding
by offering 300 livres in ransom for their bells.
"So miserable and wretched," wrote the Rector of Palais,
was his parish since the bombardment—more so even than
before, when no repairs could be executed without the assistance
of private charity, that the Church would be unable to
exist, did the Commandant of Artillery act on his rights
with rigour." They therefore prayed him to leave the bells
untouched, that the services might be notified to the people;
and to suffer them to be redeemed by the sum above mentioned:
with which request Brigadier Desaguliers complied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various interesting occurrences took place early in the
siege. On the 2nd May, some guns under cavalry escort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>were ordered to occupy a village on the left of the English
camp, which had given considerable annoyance. So warm,
however, was their reception, that the cavalry withdrew,
with some precipitation. The guns pressed on, nevertheless,
unsupported, for about 700 yards, cannonaded the village,
and dislodged the enemy. Artillery in a village, without
escort, was a strong temptation; and towards night, 300
men made an attempt to cut them off from the main body.
The gunners were awake, withdrew their guns behind some
rising ground about 1450 yards from the Citadel, and kept
their assailants at bay. Next morning, General Hodgson
visited the spot, and was so charmed with its natural advantages
that he ordered it to be entrenched, and strong batteries
mounted. The same was done at this time in front of
the Burnt Village, about 900 yards from the Citadel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy did not content himself with answering the
English cannonade. Sorties were frequent; and on one dark
night, Major-General Crawford and his staff, taken unawares,
were made prisoners in the trenches. Many more would
have met the same fate, but for the presence of mind of the
gunners in charge of two light field-pieces which happened
to be in the trenches that evening. They were charged by
several hundred men, including a spiking party, but with
well-aimed and frequent volleys of grape, the gunners utterly
routed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fire of the enemy was by no means contemptible; in
fact, until a number of their guns were dismounted, it was
both admirable and effective. On one occasion, a sergeant
and thirteen men in the trenches were killed by the explosion
of one of the enemy's shells; and so numerous at last were
the casualties among the Artillery, that the Brigadier had to
apply for 200 men from the infantry to assist in working
the guns. There was great difficulty in obtaining even that
number: the duties of the camp were hard; and the importance
of keeping the Artillery ranks at a siege well filled
was not yet fully understood. But with the progress of the
siege, came an increase of wisdom; and, before long, not a
requisition from the Brigadier was unattended to.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>All the available sea-service mortars had been landed from
the ships; but a few vessels of lighter draught stood in to
attack the Citadel from the sea with their guns. The effect
produced was but slight, perhaps because—as an old diary
of the siege says—"There were no Artillery people, either
officers or men, aboard."</p>

<p class='c000'>The English works were gradually approached to within
musketry range of the Citadel; and to enable the working
parties to carry on their duties without molestation from the
enemy's marksmen, a heavy and somewhat wasteful fire was
kept up from the batteries, which had at length to be put a
stop to by the Brigadier, for reasons of economy.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the fire of the English Artillery was effective, was
ascertained from prisoners, who said, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que c'étoit un feu
infernal, et qu'on ne voyoit ni ciel, ni terre</span>;" and, when on
parole in the town of Palais, a favourite joke among the
French prisoners, when they saw an Artillery officer approaching,
was to run behind the nearest cover, shouting
"Gare la bombe! Gare la bombe!"</p>

<p class='c000'>When the second parallel was opened, the Navy commenced
landing some 32-pounders to arm a battery which
some amateur engineers had made, and as additional mortar
batteries had also been constructed, the works were now so
extensive, that the Artillery was utterly unable to man them
all. General Hodgson, accordingly, issued a standing order
that as many men from the infantry as Brigadier Desaguliers
should require were to be given, and while employed with
the Artillery, their pay and allowances were to be made equal
to those of the matrosses.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the occupation of Palais by the British troops, much
trouble was caused by drunkenness among the men, and its
concomitants, absence and insubordination. The Provost-Marshal
was at last ordered to live there, and got very
extensive powers. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter alia</span></i>, he was permitted "to <em>hang</em> any
soldiers committing <em>any</em> kind of irregularities; above all
to lay hold of any soldier whom he found drunk on duty,
and when he became sober to hang him without trial."</p>

<p class='c000'>When the civil officials of Palais had occasion to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>into the trenches on business, they were always blindfolded
while there. Their business was generally of a commercial
nature: they were ready to accept English money for their
wares, but were anxious to be the appraisers of the value of
the foreign coins. At last, it was necessary to publish in
orders a standard, regulating the comparative values of
French and English specie,—the guinea being valued at 24
livres; and if any tradesman was found cheating in this
respect, he was made liable to confiscation of his goods, and
corporal punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the siege approached its end, many of the redoubts
near the Citadel fell into the hands of the British; and the
duties of the officers of Artillery became somewhat lighter.
It is pleasant to find that, instead of availing themselves
of their comparative leisure, they all immediately offered
their services as engineers, an offer which was greedily
accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ordnance stores were sadly reduced, and the Navy had
not another round to spare; so that fresh requisitions had to
be sent to England more than once. Pending a reply, a
very strict economy was enjoined; firing in volleys was forbidden,
and single rounds were directed to be fired day and
night at stated intervals. Twenty-four rounds per gun was
laid down as the daily maximum; but an exception was
permitted, should the Citadel seem to be on fire, in which
case even volleys were allowed. Even to the end, when the
number of available guns in the Citadel was much reduced,
the fire of the enemy was excellent; twice the English
magazines were blown up, and only five days before the
capitulation a most severe loss was inflicted on the besiegers,
Brigadier Desaguliers himself being among the
wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy was able by means of subterranean passages
and signalling to keep up a constant communication with
the mainland. Nor did he confine himself to these. An
apparently innocent and respectable old lady was found
traversing the English lines one morning under suspicious
circumstances. She was questioned without success. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>profession—she said—was simple; she was a washerwoman,
and in the exercise of her vocation had she been seized.
A stronger measure was taken: the old lady was searched.
Her countenance fell as the operation commenced; fell yet
more as dozens of letters were produced from hidden places,
containing piteous appeals for assistance from the beleaguered
citizens. But even yet she protested her innocence, her astonishment,
and her trade; and, yet protesting, with a rope
round her neck, she was led away. Whether the rope was
afterwards tightened or not, the story does not tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Breaching batteries were opened in front of the second
parallel and of the town of Palais, the latter at a distance of
230 yards from the Citadel. It was armed with 24-pounders
by the Artillery in a single night, although the guns had
to be dragged over frightful roads from the landing-place,
and without any appliances for diminishing the labour. The
zeal and willingness of the men were unmistakable. Yet a
third breaching battery was opened to the left of St. Sebastian's
Church, about 380 yards from the Citadel; and the
guns of the original 16-gun battery were also brought into
play to assist in making the breach. At first the energies of
the Artillery were confined to a breach which was attempted
in the Redan du Havre, between the Bastion du Gouvernement
and the Bastion du Cavalier ou du Roy. But a second
breach was afterwards commenced in the latter of these
Bastions. Powerful enfilading batteries of howitzers and
12-pounders were opened at the same time, whose fire proved
most efficacious, as was seen after the capitulation by the
number of damaged and dismounted guns along the faces of
the works. From the end of May to the 7th June, the day
when the Citadel surrendered, there was daily and hourly
expectation of submission by the Garrison. The prisoners
who were taken at this time all agreed in saying that the
commandant merely waited for a breach being made, before
he should capitulate. Not merely was the enemy's fire
becoming daily weaker, but the ammunition was evidently
falling short, <em>wooden</em> shot being not unfrequently fired by
him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Mining had been commenced by the English, a shaft
having been sunk under a house in Palais, and a passage
commenced under the ditch—which was wet at high water—towards
the Redan du Havre. The miners also made several
attempts by night, when the tide was out, to cross the ditch
and enlarge the breaches made by the batteries, but without
much success, the enemy being alert, and throwing hand-grenades
among them as they crossed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th June, the King's birthday, a tremendous fire
was kept up from all the batteries, and additional ammunition
having arrived from England, the Brigadier gave permission
for thirty rounds per gun, instead of twenty-four,
being fired from the ordinary batteries—no limit being
placed on the number to be fired from the breaching batteries.
The mortar batteries were now kept silent, the
powder being more profitably employed for the guns firing
against the breaches.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the 7th June, no less than ninety-three
pieces of ordnance were in use against the Citadel, and on
this day the long-expected white flag was seen, and an
officer came out to make the best terms he could for the
garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were, briefly, that the Citadel with all its stores
should be handed over to the British troops: that the French
garrison should be provided with transport to the nearest
French port; that the sick and wounded left behind should
be treated in the same manner as the British soldiers; and
that the inhabitants of the island should be allowed full permission
to worship according to the rites of the Roman
Catholic religion. Further, in consideration of the gallant
defence made by the Chevalier de St. Croix and his troops,
they were permitted to march out of the Citadel with the
honours of war, drums beating, colours flying, lighted
matches, and three pieces of cannon with twelve rounds
each; and each soldier carrying fifteen rounds of ammunition
in his cartouche box.</p>

<p class='c000'>An inventory of the Ordnance and stores was at once
taken by Brigadier Desaguliers; and on a garrison for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>island being decided on, the following Artillery officers were
selected to remain behind, and form part of it:—Captain
Hind, Captain-Lieutenant Martin, Lieutenant Rogers, and
Lieutenant-Fireworkers Rosat, Skottowe, and Mayne. The
remainder of the Artillery embarked on Christmas Day, 1761,
for England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the orders issued during the siege, which enable
one to form an idea of the weather which prevailed, is one
directing the hides of all animals killed for the troops to be
taken to the trenches for the use of the Artillery in making
their expense-magazines water-tight.</p>

<p class='c000'>From an old order-book in the Royal Artillery Library
the discipline of the troops after the siege, and the means
taken to enforce it, may be ascertained. Three men of the
75th Regiment having been found guilty of drunkenness
and absence from the King's works, received 300 lashes each,
and were debarred from employment on the works again.
Two men of Colonel Morgan's Regiment having been convicted
of disorderly behaviour were sentenced to receive 200
lashes each "on their bare backs;" and another, in the
19th Regiment, received 100 lashes for drunkenness and disobedience.
A man in Crawford's Regiment, who had been
convicted of prevarication on a court-martial by which one
of his officers was tried, was sentenced to receive 500 lashes;
but as it appeared by the evidence that he had been under
pressure and undue influence by the prisoner at the time,
the sentence was remitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to have been a want of zeal on the part of
the chaplains, if one may judge from the following order:—"Palais,
26 November, 1761. Whenever any patient dies in
any of the Grand Hospitals, the principal surgeon attached
to the Hospital where the patient dies is immediately to
send a written report of his death, and the time he would
have him interred, to the visiting chaplain then in waiting,
who is, conformable to a former order of Major-General
Hodgson, to attend the corpse at the grave, and read the
burial-service over it. General Hodgson is extremely concerned
that he has occasion to repeat the latter part of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>order, and expects for the future that he shall not hear
any complaints on this subject."</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be mentioned, in concluding this chapter, that at
the Peace of 1763 Belleisle was returned to the French in
exchange for Minorca, which England had lost at the commencement
of the Seven Years' War.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='sc'>Peace.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>At</span> the conclusion of the war in 1763, the reductions in
the Regiment were carried out on a different system
from that which had hitherto prevailed. At the Peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle, entire companies had been reduced, and the
establishment of the remaining companies was left unchanged.
Now, the cadres of the three Battalions with their companies
remained, but the establishment of the latter was
materially reduced. Besides the Cadet company, there were
now thirty others; and the total in each company of all
ranks was—as it had been twenty years before—107. But
the following reduction was now ordered—one Lieutenant-Fireworker,
one Sergeant, one Corporal, four bombardiers,
twelve gunners, and thirty-two matrosses per company,
reducing the total from 107 to 57, a fifer having been added
to each. The supernumerary fireworkers were put on half-pay,
and brought in as vacancies occurred,—the last being
absorbed in 1767.</p>

<p class='c000'>From 1763 to 1771 was a singularly uneventful period
in the history of the Regiment. One Battalion was quartered
in America, its head-quarters being at Woolwich; the
companies of another were divided between Gibraltar and
Minorca, and the third was in Great Britain. The companies
in the East Indies remained as before until 1765. A relief
of the 2nd by the 1st Battalion took place towards the end of
this time; and the companies at home were periodically
relieved as at present. One peculiarity, however, existed
then, which does so no longer. When two or more companies
were required from Woolwich for out-stations at home,
the Captains were ordered to meet at the Commandant's
office, and draw lots for their destinations. As a means of
silencing grumblers, it was certainly advantageous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Although England was at peace, other countries had their
troubles; and Portugal, being in distress as regarded her
Artillery, applied during this time for the services of Captain
Macbean, who had served her so well before, and various
other officers of the Regiment. The request was granted:
the officers being made supernumerary, their promotion going
on, but their pay coming from the Portuguese Government.
Captain Macbean reached the highest rank in the Portuguese
service, and all the others received the strongest commendations.—One—Captain-Lieutenant
Yorke—died in Portugal:
the same officer, who, as a subaltern, with a handful of men,
managed to get a gun up the heights above Quebec, when
Wolfe made his famous and successful attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was not the first instance of a Foreign Government
paying the compliment to the Royal Artillery of asking
assistance from its ranks. In 1744, the King of Sardinia
asked and obtained the services of five officers and twenty-four
men of the Royal Artillery, who were on board the
bomb-vessels in the Mediterranean; and they served with
distinction in his Army until taken prisoners at the capture
of Montalban and Montleuze.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some changes in the dress of the officers were made during
this time. In 1768 white waistcoats, instead of scarlet, and
white breeches were adopted both for officers and men. In
1770, swords were substituted for the fusees which had
hitherto been the arms of the officers, and the same sword
exercise was adopted as was in use among dragoons. At the
same time, the Regiment adopted the German mode of wearing
the sash round the waist, instead of over the right
shoulder, as hitherto. Epaulettes were also substituted for
laced shoulder-knots. The non-commissioned officers and
men wore their hair plaited, and turned up behind with a
black ribbon or tape, three quarters of a yard long, in a <em>bow</em>-knot
where tied; and if any men were debarred by nature
or accident from wearing their hair sufficiently long, they
were compelled to wear a false plait—anticipating by a
century the present custom of the other sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letter-books of this time are chiefly devoted to correspondence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>on matters connected with clothing, promotion
and reliefs. On the first named subject, the correspondence
with Major James, who commanded at New York, is particularly
voluminous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Promotion was slow; and when accelerated by retirement
of officers, the system pursued was peculiar. For
example, it was decided to remove Captain-Lieutenant
Rogers to the half-pay list. His half-pay,—six shillings
per diem, was to be augmented by two shillings from the
Board of Ordnance; but—by an ingenious arrangement,
whereby the Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant, and Lieutenant-Fireworker,
who got promotion, were made to remain
on their old rate of pay, six shillings and fourpence per
diem was saved towards Captain Rogers' half-pay, and the
Board had only to find the daily sum of one shilling and eightpence.
At this time, in the year 1765, the Board placed the
responsibility of the men's clothing on the Colonels of Battalions,
declining any further interference. The wisdom of
the change—except in so far as it saved trouble to the
Honourable Board—was questionable; for some Colonels
took a very liberal view of their discretion and power in the
matter, going so far even as to alter the <em>colour</em> as well as
the shape of the various articles of their men's uniform.</p>

<p class='c000'>An excellent and hospitable officer, General Williamson,
now commanded at Woolwich; and one of his invitations to
his friends is so quaint as to be worthy of reproduction:—"July
25th, 1767. The gentlemen of twenty years' acquaintance
are desired to meet General Williamson, and dine at
'The Bull' on Shooter's Hill, on Monday next, 1st August,
their names to be sent to Dr. Irwin. Dinner on table at three
o'clock." The General had a son in the Regiment, at this
time in New York, who was as great a favourite as his father.</p>

<p class='c000'>This time of peace was beneficial to the Royal Military
Academy. More time was devoted to the curriculum, and
inducements to proficiency held out successfully to the cadets.
The King and Queen paid a visit to the Academy, among
the other lions of Woolwich. It was on this occasion that
"their Majesties saw many curious firings; among the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>a large iron cannon, fired by a lock like a common gun; a
heavy 12-pounder, fired 23 times in a minute, and spunged
every time by a new and wonderful contrivance, said to be
the invention of Dr. Desaguliers, with other astonishing
improvements of the like kind."<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> In 1765, a most formal
examination of the cadets had taken place in presence of the
Master-General and principal officers of the Ordnance, and
many other important officials, including the President of
the Royal Society, who expressed their satisfaction with the
"noble institution," and distributed gold and silver medals
to the most distinguished cadets. In a hundred years, one
who had been himself a cadet at the Royal Military Academy,
and for many years an honoured officer in the Royal Artillery,
Sir Edward Sabine, would occupy the chair filled by one of
the visitors on that day, and be one of the most popular
Presidents of the Royal Society.</p>

<p class='c000'>The names of the following officers appear during this
peaceful time, as in command of companies:—Captains Foy,
Drummond, and Stehelin, at Minorca; Torriano, Innes, and
Butler, at Gibraltar; Jeffery, Phillips, Smith, Carter, and
Howdell, at Woolwich. In America, we trace companies
commanded at different times by Captains Martin, Williams,
Farrington, Hay, Ferguson, Webdall, Lewis, Dover, Walton,
Winter, Carlisle, and Gillespie. The stations on that continent
which were the head-quarters of the companies included
New York, Pensacola, Quebec, Halifax, Pittsburg
(Louisbourg), Montreal, and Placentia in Newfoundland.
There were also detachments at Boston, Crown Point, Fort
Ontario, and Niagara.</p>

<p class='c000'>An amusing narrative of the service of a bombardier and
two matrosses who were permitted to accept employment
from the Emperor of Morocco may prove an interesting conclusion
to this short chapter. It is based upon a manuscript
in the Royal Artillery Library, framed by the bombardier
himself, one John Turner by name, who had been called upon
to make a report of his doings during his absence, and who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>certainly even on his own showing had a keen eye to the
main chance. The ineffable conceit of the man, his firm impression
that Emperors and Princes only existed to give him
his daily pay and rations, and his exalted notion of his
position as a bombardier in the Royal Artillery, can only be
realized by a complete perusal of the manuscript. But even
if curtailed, the narrative cannot fail to amuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>John Turner was quartered at Gibraltar. He was a fair
scholar, had a good opinion of himself, and was a bombardier.
In the summer of 1769, the Emperor of Morocco sent a
request to the Governor of Gibraltar for an Artilleryman to
explain certain matters in gunnery, and to act as a tutor in
the military art to the young Prince, his son. In 1872, it
is probable that for such an appointment candidates would
be innumerable, and would embrace even General Officers
among their numbers. Possibly in Gibraltar, the Emperor
was not very highly esteemed; be that, however, as it may,
Bombardier John Turner was selected. He was to receive
thirty-five dollars per month, besides certain other advantages,
and this fact was very present to his mind during his
absence. At first, a circumstance which occurred vexed John
Turner's soul sorely: the wind having detained him some
days, the Governor was relieved by one who would not
assume the responsibility of letting him go, without an order
from England. Until November the honest man was kept
fretting and pining, but in the end he was rewarded not
merely by the permission to go himself, but by an order to
take with him two matrosses, who greatly swelled his importance.
On the 3rd of December, he and his comrades landed
about six miles from Tetuan, whither they were conveyed
on mules and lodged in a house where they were treated
"beyond their expectation." It was but seldom that in this
respect John Turner's expectations were exceeded. He had
a letter to the Governor, which he insisted on presenting;
and with much presence of mind, on the morning after his
arrival, he demanded an advance of money for himself and
comrades. This was granted; but, as he plaintively wrote,
it was made the subject of much misrepresentation, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>was reprimanded by his superiors in Gibraltar, on the story
reaching them. The fact was, he innocently said, that he
had borrowed some money on his note of hand in Gibraltar,
"to clear some little obligations under which we lay," and
the note met him at Tetuan, where he was led to believe he
would be put in funds to pay it. On the 17th, the party
left in great state "with an Alcayde and three horsemen for
our guard, hired horses to ride on, and mules to carry our
baggage and camp equipage." They encamped every night
near some village, and the inhabitants were compelled to
bring them food, and find sentinels for their baggage, under
pain of being taken as rebels to the Emperor, for which purpose
chains were carried by the escort. The good bombardier
describes in his report at some length the nature of the
food, some of which he was pleased to consider very good
eating. At last they reached the place where the young
Prince was encamped, and from that moment John Turner
became an old man of the sea to that unhappy youth, and
when he had any complaint to make would go nowhere but
to head-quarters. His early interviews with the Prince, and
every word that passed between them are duly chronicled.
He accompanied him to Mequinez, and immediately sought
the Emperor's Secretary, to whom he had letters. The frank
manners of that official at first charmed John; but he soon
found him to be but "a master of the French address, joined
to all the villainies of the Court of Morocco, and a Jew in
the very essence of the word." In a few days he had an
interview with the Emperor himself, who in the course of
conversation asked to see his instruments. It may interest
the modern Artilleryman to know what a bombardier's instruments
were in the year 1770. Those which John produced
were his "quadrant, perpendicular, and Gunter's scales,
together with a case of mathematical instruments."</p>

<p class='c000'>The unfortunate bombardier never saw his instruments
after he once let them into the young Prince's hands, and
this called forth very severe strictures from him on princely
nature. "Plundering," he writes, "is what these Princes
are taught from their infancy."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>The Emperor having expressed a wish to see the three
Artillerymen throw a shell, they complied. The mortar was
of a different calibre from any they had ever seen, nor did
they know anything about the range; fortunately, however,
they made a good guess, and the Emperor was much pleased
with the practice. He ordered them a daily supply of provisions,
"which order, however, was never complied with
but in part."</p>

<p class='c000'>From this moment John's domestic troubles were very
great. While he had enough meat he never abused it; but
when his allowance was cut short, he described it as "carrion
meat." He was quartered in a Jew's house, and the Jew
plundered him sorely, depriving him of the best part of his
provisions. He said little, but thought a good deal; and
receiving no satisfaction from the Imperial Secretary, demanded
to see the Prince, who came to him immediately.
"I acquainted him how ill we were treated with regard to
provisions, and as our money was all gone begged of His
Royal Highness to take some method that we might be
better supplied. He asked whose fault it was. I answered,
'The Chief of the Jews.' He ordered our interpreter to go
and tell him that if he did not find us everything, as his
father had ordered, he would cut off his head, and burn his
body; and desired, whenever we found him in the least
deficient, to call a guard of Moors, and bring the Chief of
the Jews to him, and we should see him executed. He
then dismissed us, and we went home, and almost as soon
as we went there one of the Prince's black servants came
with the Chief of the Jews, and a halter about his neck,
and told us by the interpreter that he was ordered to bring
him there, and give him fifty bastinados in our presence,
which he did, notwithstanding we offered to buy off the
punishment with six ounces."</p>

<p class='c000'>The climax of John Turner's narrative is when he describes
a day's shell practice with the Prince in presence of the
Emperor, when the powder of the country, of whose strength
John was ignorant, was used. The young Prince made good
practice with it, but as he would not impart the secret of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>strength, the Artillerymen made very indifferent shooting.
His Majesty remonstrated, making invidious comparisons,
which roused John Turner into reminding the Emperor with
due deference that he came there to instruct His Majesty's
subjects in the <em>English</em> method of practice, not to be instructed
by the Prince—he being master of his business before
he came there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another day's practice followed: The Prince hit the mark
with one of his shells, the bombardier did not. It was a
painful circumstance; but the conceit of John Turner did
not fail him. He first blamed the powder, and then asserted
that, notwithstanding his failure to hit the mark, his general
practice was infinitely superior to that of his Royal pupil.
And he submitted a chart of the day's shooting in support of
his statement.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is but fair to say that Bombardier Turner was most conscientious
in performing another duty which was enjoined
upon him, the construction of a small laboratory. He writes
with the greatest scorn of the native artificers, but he succeeded
in making them do what he wished. Just, however,
as he had overcome the main difficulties, his peace of mind
was disturbed by his two chronic wants, lack of money and
scarcity of provisions. This time he resolved to write to the
Emperor himself; and endeavoured to get some one to translate
his remonstrances into Arabic with that view. He failed,
however, and had to content himself with the Prince, whose
life, by means of his interpreter, he was able to make a
burden to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader of his report is not surprised to find that after
a very short time his services were dispensed with, and he
was directed to return to Gibraltar. A man who insists on
afflicting royalty with the most trivial complaints becomes
a very unwelcome inmate of a despotic Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>So John and his comrades started, grumbling to the last,
and his conceit and self-importance manifesting themselves
at every stage of the journey. Carefully mentioning that he
was still allowed an Imperial escort, he points out another
instance of shabby treatment to which he was exposed. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>should be mentioned that when the horses requisite for his
comfort were not forthcoming, the gallant bombardier always
declined to move. On one evening he was informed that
the requisite cattle would be ready next morning. "Our
things being ready by the time," he writes, "I went to see
the cattle that was prepared for us. I found only four
mules barely sufficient to carry our baggage. I enquired
where I and the two men were to ride, and was informed—on
the top of the baggage. I said that since I had been
in the country I was never asked to travel in this manner;
neither did I think His Majesty would be pleased if he
knew how we were treated; and, moreover, not any of <em>my</em>
baggage should be moved until three saddle-horses should
be brought for me and my companions. He said, as for
me, I might ride on one of his horses, but I absolutely
refused, adding it was equally my duty to take care of
those men as of myself, and until I saw cattle enough to
carry us and our baggage, I would not stir from the place,
unless it was to return and acquaint the Emperor of our
usage."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is sufficient to say that on this, as on every similar
occasion, the bombardier carried his point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day arrived when they were to take ship from Tetuan to
Gibraltar. To the very last his pecuniary difficulties haunted
him. They were directed to attend at a notary's office to receive
their pay. A sum far inferior to what he considered his due
was offered him. "I informed them," he writes, "that that was
not near the sum that was due to us; but was given to
understand that if I did not accept that, I might possibly get
none; and rather than run that hazard, as I knew them
capable of any meanness, I took what was offered, and gave
a receipt in part payment. We were likewise out of this
short payment obliged to pay our interpreter; but this I
did with less reluctance, as I had been informed by Mr.
Rodway, Master-Wheeler, of Gibraltar, that whenever he
went to Mequinez by order of Government, he always paid
his interpreter himself, but that the money was always
returned to him at Gibraltar." The exquisite delicacy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the hint at repayment, embodied in an official report, cannot
be surpassed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In days long after John Turner's career was finished, the
spectacle has been witnessed of an invaded country straining
every nerve, and practising every self-denial, to procure
the withdrawal from its occupied districts of the enemy's
troops. It is questionable, however, whether its eagerness
was equal to that which must have been felt on all sides
when that memorable event occurred which it has been
attempted to describe,—the invasion of Morocco by a bombardier.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1770, the Regiment suffered from two evils:
one, the chronic slowness of promotion which has always
afflicted it; the other, an inability to carry out the foreign
reliefs with so small a number of companies at home. To
meet these evils a remedy was devised, which shall be treated
in the next chapter—the formation of another Battalion.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Fourth Battalion.—The History and Present<br /> Designation of the Companies.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>This</span> Battalion was formed on the 1st January, 1771, by
drafting six companies from the Battalions already in
existence, which were thus reduced from ten to eight companies,
and by the formation, in addition, of two new
companies. At the same date, eight companies of invalids
were formed from the men on out-pension, two of which were
attached to each Battalion, but were not borne upon the
effective strength. These eight companies were consolidated
in 1779 in one invalid battalion, with a regular staff, and
effective companies were raised for the other battalions, in
their stead.</p>

<p class='c000'>On its first formation, the companies of the 4th Battalion
were very weak, consisting each of 1 Captain, 1 Captain-Lieutenant,
2 First Lieutenants, 2 Second Lieutenants, 2 Sergeants,
2 Corporals, 4 bombardiers, 8 gunners, 52 matrosses,
and 2 drummers. The staff of the Battalion consisted of a
Colonel-Commandant, a Lieutenant-Colonel, a Major, an Adjutant,
a Quartermaster, and a Chaplain. Colonel Ord, the
first Colonel-Commandant, had greatly distinguished himself
in North America in 1759 and 1760; and it was a happy
coincidence that he should receive the command of a battalion
whose services in that country were destined to be so brilliant.
These services will receive more appropriate mention
in the chapters connected with the American War of Independence,
and with the gallant officer who commanded it
during that war, General James Pattison.</p>

<p class='c000'>But two of the companies received special marks of distinction
which deserve to be mentioned. One, No. 1 Company,
now No. 4 Battery, 7th Brigade, was singled out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>after the battle of Vaux, in 1794, for its gallant conduct
during the day, and the whole Army was formed up to see
it march past the Duke on the field of battle. Another
company, No. 10, received a special mark of distinction
for its gallantry during the second American War, and
more especially at the capture of Fort Niagara. By
General Order of 7th October, 1816, it was permitted to
wear on its appointments "in addition to any badges or
devices which may have been hitherto granted to the Royal
Regiment of Artillery" the word "Niagara." This company
subsequently fell a victim to change and reduction.
It was reduced in January, 1819, after a service of forty
years, having been one of the two companies formed in 1779
to replace the invalid companies of the Battalion. It was
reformed at Woolwich on the 16th August, 1848; and on
the 3rd November in that year it became No. 6 Company
of the 12th Battalion. In 1859, when the Brigade system
was introduced, it became No. 9 Battery of the 6th Brigade;
on the 1st April, 1865, it was transferred to the 12th Brigade
as No. 8 Battery; and on the 1st February, 1871, by reduction,
it ceased to exist as such. It is a matter of regret
that the pruning-knife should be applied to the companies
which have a distinctive history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 4th Battalion afforded a precedent—although not a
happy one—for the Brigade system as applied to the Royal
Artillery. It was the only battalion which ever went on
service with its head-quarter staff. Experience soon proved
that it would have been better to leave that appendage—as
was customary—at Woolwich. The Battalion letter-books
teem with complaints as to clothing, recruiting, and pay,
which might have been obviated by having at home the usual
battalion officials, whose duties were connected with these
details. With the companies detached over the American
continent, and the head-quarters virtually imprisoned in
New York, the confusion was endless, and the natural results
excite a smile as the student reads of them. For the officials
at the Board of Ordnance exercised the same paternal interference
over the distant staff, as if they had been in Woolwich.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The time occupied by correspondence across the
Atlantic, rendered necessary by the stupidity and the curiosity
of the Ordnance officials, told heavily against the comfort
of the companies, and the peace of mind of their Captains.
The circumlocution between London and New York, New
York and all the stations on the continent where detachments
of the Battalion were stationed, and back again to the Tower,
was at once ludicrous and irritating. And the trouble caused
by the absence from England of those who would have interested
themselves in procuring suitable and creditable
recruits cannot be realized save by those who have waded
through the letter-books of the period. The companies were
fettered to a beleaguered head-quarters, which in its turn
was tied and bound to a distant department, nor was allowed
the slightest independence of action. The result may
easily be imagined. Questions which could have been
decided in a few minutes, if those interested could have met,
grew every day more complicated and unwieldy by the correspondence
at long and uncertain intervals in which the
Board of Ordnance revelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The services of the companies will now be given, in the
same manner as those of the other battalions. There are
few lists more noble than that of the military operations in
which No. 1 Company was engaged. The battery—No. 4 of
the 7th Brigade—whose history this is, may well be proud
of such noble antecedents. The revival of these may prove
a means of awakening a pride in its ranks which will be the
strongest aid to discipline, the most powerful incentive to
progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>The succession of Captains of the various companies, as far
as the somewhat mutilated records on this point will admit,
will also be given, down to the time when the nomenclature
of the companies was changed, since which date, so recent,
no difficulty will be found in continuing the lists.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='sc'>The Journal of a Few Years.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>For</span> a few years after the formation of the Fourth Battalion,
the History of the Regiment contains little that
possesses more than domestic interest. It was the stillness
which precedes a storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1775, the Titanic contest commenced, in which England
found herself pitted against France, Spain, and her own
children.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that year, until 1783, the student of her military
history finds his labour incessant. America and Europe
alike claim his attention; the War of Independence, and the
Sieges of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, furnish a wealth of
material for his examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>But before entering on these, the ground must be cleared
and the regimental gossip between 1771 and 1775 must be
chronicled.</p>

<p class='c000'>During that time, the relief of the battalion serving in
America—by the 4th—took place, and on the latter fell all
Artillery duties performed at the commencement of hostilities
in that country. As the war developed, the 4th
Battalion was reinforced by four companies of the 3rd, whose
men—and also the Lieutenant-Fireworkers—were gradually
absorbed into the 4th Battalion. At the same time, four
companies of the 1st and 3rd Battalions, under the gallant
Phillips, were ordered to America, and formed part of the
force commanded by the ill-fated Burgoyne. During this
decade, between 1770 and 1779, five companies of the 2nd
Battalion relieved those at Gibraltar, and were the only
Artillery present at that memorable siege, which sheds a
lustre over this unhappy period in the national history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woolwich saw a good many changes at this time. The
barracks in the Warren were inadequate to meet the wants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>of the Regiment, now that it had received so many augmentations.
Some ground on the Common was, therefore, purchased
by the Board, and the foundation laid of barracks,
large enough to accommodate a battalion of eight companies.
The building was completed, and the barracks inhabited,
early in 1776.</p>

<p class='c000'>Modifications in the dress of the Regiment took place; and
the evil results of the liberty granted to the Colonels of
Battalions with regard to their men's clothing manifested
themselves to such a degree, that in March, 1772, an order
was issued, forbidding any alteration in the clothing of the
men, or uniform of the officers, without the previous knowledge
and approbation of the Master-General.</p>

<p class='c000'>From various Battalion Orders issued at this time, we
learn that the officers had now to provide themselves with
plain frocks, and plain hats with a gold band, button, and
loop; and that the accoutrements of the men, which had
hitherto been buff, were now changed,—becoming what they
are at present—white. The dress for a parade under arms
was as follows:—The men, in white breeches, white stockings,
black half-spatterdashes, and their hair clubbed:—the
officers, in plain frocks, half-spatterdashes, and queues, with
white cotton or thread stockings under their spatterdashes,
and gold button and loop on their plain hats. When the
officers were on duty, they were ordered to wear their hair
clubbed, and their hats cocked in the same manner as those
of the men. The hats of the men were worn with the front
loops just over the nose. Black stocks were utterly forbidden,
white only being permitted to be worn, either by
officers or men.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 22nd June, 1772, a Royal Warrant was issued,
deciding that Captain-Lieutenants in the Artillery and
Engineers should rank as Captains in the Army. Those
who were then serving, were to have their commissions as
Captain, dated 26th May, 1772; and those who might be
subsequently commissioned, from the date of their appointment.
The title of Captain-Lieutenant was abolished, and
that of Second Captain substituted, in 1804.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>In 1772 and 1775, the regiment was reviewed by the
King—on both occasions at Blackheath. The inspections
were very satisfactory; in 1772, "The corps went through
their different evolutions with great exactness, though
greatly incommoded by the weather, and obstructed by the
prodigious concourse of people, which was greater than
ever was known on any like occasion." In addition to
these reviews, the King visited Woolwich in state in 1773,
for the purpose of inspecting the new foundry and boring-room.
In the latter, he saw a 42-pounder bored with a new
and wonderful horizontal boring-machine. He saw many
curious inventions; among others, a light field-piece, invented
by Colonel Pattison, "which, on emergencies, might be
carried on men's shoulders," and which was tried, "to the
great amazement of His Majesty." He also went to
the Academy, where he breakfasted; and then inspected the
companies which happened to be in Woolwich, with whose
manœuvres he expressed the utmost satisfaction. The
review was marred by an accident which occurred. "Colonel
Broome, in parading in front of the Regiment, before His
Majesty, on a very beautiful and well-broke horse, but
very tender-mouthed, checked him, which made the horse
rise upon his hind-legs, and fall backwards upon his rider,
who is so greatly bruised, that his life is despaired of."<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In 1772, the officers, whose extra pay on promotion had
been taken to make up the half-pay of Captain-Lieutenant
Rogers, complained of the injustice, and their remonstrances
were attended to. A warrant was issued on the 4th August,
1772, directing a vacancy of one Second Lieutenant to be
kept open in one of the invalid companies, the pay to
be employed towards Captain Rogers's half-pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to stigmatize too harshly the system of
non-effectives, borne for various purposes on the strength
of the Regiment, in which the Board of Ordnance delighted.
It was at once deceitful and unbusinesslike. If the purposes
were legitimate, they should have formed the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>of a separate vote. At the risk of wearying the reader, a
recapitulation will be given of the non-effectives in the
Regiment at this time, and the purposes for which they
were borne upon the establishment. There were thirty-two
marching companies in the Regiment, and eight of invalids.
On the muster-roll of each company, a dummy—so to speak—was
borne, whose pay went to the Widows' Fund;
another per company, for what was called the Non-effective
Fund, and a third, whose pay went to remunerate the fifer.
In addition to this, ten dummies were borne, whose pay went
to swell General Belford's income, in the form of command
pay; and nine were utilized for the band.</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, out of 1088 matrosses, shown as the establishment
of the marching companies, no less than 115 had no
existence; and in the invalid companies, a Second Lieutenant
and 16 matrosses were equally shadowy. If we examine the
purposes for which the fund called the non-effective fund
existed, shall we find them to be irregular, or such as could
not be made public? Not at all; the charges on this fund
were legitimate, and a separate vote might and should have
been taken, particularizing them. They were to meet the
expenses connected with recruits, deserters, and discharged
invalids, as well as certain contingent charges, connected
with the command of companies. Why then the mystery,
and deceit practised upon the public? If the senior officer
of Artillery was deserving of higher pay on account of his
services or responsibility, why not openly say so, instead
of showing to the country, as part of the Artillery establishment,
ten men who had no existence? The wickedness
and folly of such a means of keeping accounts could only
have emanated from such a Department as the Board of
Ordnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mention has been made of recruiting expenses. Certain
regulations which were in force at this time may be interesting
to the reader. Levy money was not allowed to the
recruiting officer in cases where the recruits were not approved
by the commanding officer, but their subsistence
after enlistment until rejection, was admitted. If a recruit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>deserted before joining, no charge whatever was admitted
against the fund. But if he died between enlistment and
the time when he should have joined, all expenses connected
with him were admitted on production of the necessary
vouchers and certificates. When the non-effective fund was
balanced, which was done annually on the 30th June, 5<em>l.</em>
was credited to the accounts of the coming year, for each
man wanting to complete the establishment, in order to
meet the expenses of the recruits who would be enlisted to
fill the vacancies.</p>

<p class='c000'>A word, now, about the invalids. They were for service
in the garrisons; at first, merely in Great Britain, but
ultimately also abroad, for in 1775, when the war in Massachusetts
was assuming considerable proportions, the company
of the 4th Battalion, which was quartered in Newfoundland,
was ordered to Boston; and the two companies of invalids,
shown as belonging to that battalion, and then quartered at
Portsmouth, were ordered to Newfoundland for duty. Men
over twenty years' service were drafted from the marching
to the invalid companies, instead of being discharged with a
pension; and the companies were officered from the regiment,
appointments in the various ranks being given to the senior
applicants.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1779, two additional invalid companies were added, and
the ten were consolidated into one battalion, effective companies
being given to the other battalions in their room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The staff of the Invalid Battalion consisted of a Lieutenant-Colonel
Commandant, a Major, and an Adjutant; and the
establishment of each company was as follows:—a Captain,
a First and Second Lieutenant, 1 Sergeant, 1 Corporal,
1 Drummer, 3 Bombardiers, 6 Gunners, and 36 Matrosses.
Although this battalion was fifth in order of formation, and
was frequently called the Fifth Battalion,—the real Fifth
Battalion, the services of which are sketched in the end of
this volume, was not formed until much nearer the close of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1772, a Military Society was founded at Woolwich for
the discussion of professional questions. It was originated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>by two officers at Gibraltar—Jardine and Williams—extracts
from whose letters to one another, when the idea occurred to
them, are quaintly amusing. Lieutenant Jardine writes:—"I
have been thinking that there must be a good deal of
knowledge scattered about in this numerous corps. Could
it not be collected, concentrated, and turned to some
effect? We have already in this country all kinds of
Societies, except Military ones. I think a voluntary association
might be formed among us (admitting, perhaps,
Engineers and others) on liberal principles, viz., for their
own improvement and amusement, where military, mathematical,
and philosophical knowledge, being the chief object
of their enquiries, essays, &amp;c., might thus be improved and
propagated. They might thus communicate and increase
their own ideas, preserve themselves from vulgar errors,
and keeping one another in countenance, bear up against
the contempt of pert and presumptive ignorance. If it
increased in numbers, and grew into consequence, they
might in time bring study and real knowledge into fashion,
and, retorting a juster contempt, keep mediocrity, and
false or no merit, down to their proper sphere."</p>

<p class='c000'>His correspondent, who was then on board a transport,
and wrote under difficulties, eagerly entered into the scheme,
but for reasons stated could not go into details. "I have
many things," he writes, "in my head, but our band (consisting
of geese screaming, ducks quacking, hogs grunting,
dogs growling, puppies barking, brats squalling, and all
hands bawling) are now performing a full piece, so that
whatever my pericranium labours with, it must lie concealed
until I arrive at Retirement's Lying-in Hospital, in
Solitude Row, where I shall hope for a happy delivery."</p>

<p class='c000'>The friends reached Woolwich that year; and in October
the society was formed. There happened to be many among
the senior officers who sympathized with the promoters,
notably Generals Williamson and Desaguliers, and Colonels
Pattison and Phillips. The meetings took place at 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on
every Saturday preceding the full moon; and were secret,
in order that an inventor might communicate his discoveries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>without fear of their appropriation. With the author's consent,
however, papers might be published. The carrying-on
of experiments was one of the main purposes which animated
the society. At the present day, when the idea which
animated the promoters of the old society has blossomed into
a Literary and Scientific Institution, unparalleled in any
corps in any land, which not merely encourages and developes
the intelligence and literary talent of its members,
but aids, in the highest degree, to lift the corps out of
mediocrity into science,—these old facts connected with the
infant society have a peculiar interest. The year 1872 may
look back to 1772 with filial regard.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th July, 1773, the 4th Battalion arrived in New
York—with the exception of one company, which went to
Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a very brief period, the political atmosphere in
that country became hopelessly overcast, and with the outbreak
of the storm at Boston, in 1775, commences at once
the active history of the American War, and of the Royal
Artillery during that war, which is to be treated by itself.
But parallel with that long and disastrous campaign, and
occupying a period extending from 1779 to 1783, was the
great siege of Gibraltar. To prevent an interruption in the
thread of the American narrative, it is proposed to anticipate
matters, and passing over the years 1775 to 1778, when the
eye of the student can see nothing but America, proceed at
once to the consideration of the siege, and then return to an
uninterrupted consideration of the Artillery share in the
American War from 1775 to the Peace of 1783.</p>

<p class='c030'>"Neither, while the war lasts, will Gibraltar surrender. Not though
Crillon, Nassau, Siegen, with the ablest projectors extant, are there;
and Prince Condé and Prince d'Artois have hastened to help. Wondrous
leather-roofed floating-batteries, set afloat by French-Spanish <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pacte de
famille</span></i>, give gallant summons; to which, nevertheless, Gibraltar answers
Plutonically, with mere torrents of red-hot iron,—as if stone Calpe had
become a throat of the Pit; and utters such a Doom's-blast of a No, as
all men must credit."—<span class='sc'>Carlyle.</span></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> year 1779 saw England engaged in war on both
sides of the Atlantic, with bitter and jealous enemies.
Her struggle with the revolted colonies offered a tempting
opportunity to France to wipe out her losses during the
Seven Years' War,—and to Spain, to wipe out the disgrace
which she felt in the possession of Gibraltar by the English.
France, accordingly, espoused the cause of the Americans;
and Spain, under pretence of the rejection of an offer of
mediation between England and France, proposed in terms
which could not be accepted, immediately declared a war,
which had been decided upon from the day of the disaster at
Saratoga, and for which preparations had been progressing
for some time without any pretence of concealment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Royal Artillery in this year consisted of thirty-two
<em>service</em> companies, and eight <em>invalid</em>. The augmentation
referred to in the last chapter did not take place until the
end of the year. Of this number, one-half—sixteen companies—was
in America; one company in Newfoundland;
three in the West Indies; three in Minorca; and five in
Gibraltar:—a total abroad of twenty-eight service companies
out of thirty-two. Nor was it a foreign service, so weary and
uneventful as it sometimes is now: it was a time when England
was fighting almost for existence, and every company
had to share the dangers. Should such a rising against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>England ever occur again, the Regiment could not select as
its model for imitation anything nobler than the five companies
which were in Gibraltar during the great siege.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the five senior companies of the 2nd Battalion,
and they still exist, under the altered nomenclature, as,—</p>

<p class='c000'>At the commencement of the siege, Colonel Godwin was
in command of the Artillery; but he returned to England
in the following year, on promotion to the command of the
Battalion, and died in about six years. He was succeeded
by Colonel Tovey, the same officer who had been present
with his company at Belleisle; and who, having had practical
experience of Siege Artillery of the attack, was now to
head a train of Artillery of the defence, in which duty and
command he died. On his death, which happened at a most
exciting period of the siege, he was succeeded by Major
Lewis, whose conspicuous gallantry and severe wounds earned
for him a well-deserved Good Service Pension.</p>

<p class='c000'>The strength of the Artillery was wholly inadequate to
the number of guns on the Rock. It amounted to a total of
25 officers, and 460 non-commissioned officers and men;
whereas, at the termination of the siege, the following was
the serviceable and mounted armament:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Guns.</em>—Seventy-seven 32-pounders; one hundred and
twenty-two 24-pounders and 26-pounders; one hundred and
four 18-pounders; seventy 12-pounders; sixteen 9-pounders;
twenty-five 6-pounders; thirty-eight 4-pounders and 3-pounders.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mortars.</em>—Twenty-nine 13-inch; one 10-inch; six 8-inch;
and thirty-four of smaller natures.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Howitzers.</em>—Nineteen 10-inch, and nine 8-inch.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the first steps taken by the Governor, General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Eliott, was to attach 180 men from the infantry to the
Artillery, to learn gunnery, and assist in the duties of the
latter. The regiments in garrison were the 12th, 39th, 56th,
and 58th, also the (then) 72nd regiment. The (then) 73rd
and 97th regiments joined during the siege. There were
also 124 Engineers and artificers, and three regiments of
Hanoverian troops. The total strength of all ranks in June
1779, was 5382; but it increased before the siege was over—by
means of reinforcements from England—to 7000.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few statistics connected with the Artillery and their
duties may, perhaps, with advantage be prefaced to the
account of the siege.</p>

<p class='c000'>The amount of ammunition expended between September
1779|and February 1783, was as follows:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c012'>Shot</td>
    <td class='c011'>57,163</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>In all 200,600 rounds, and 8000 barrels of powder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preponderance of the number of shell over shot was
caused by the use, during the siege, of shell from <em>guns</em>, with
reduced charges—as well as from mortars and howitzers;
suggested by Captain Mercier, of the 39th Regiment, and
found so successful, as almost to abolish the use of shot
during the first two years. In the year 1782, however, the
value of red-hot shot against the enemy's fleet and works
was discovered; the amount of shot expended rapidly increased;
and while there was hardly a battery without the
means at hand for heating them, there was also a constant
supply, already heated, in the chief batteries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The batteries from which the Artillery generally fired on
the land side were those known collectively as Willis's; but
when the fleet, and especially the hornet-like gunboats,
commenced annoying the garrison, the batteries towards the
sea had also to be manned, and the duty became so severe,
that at times the fire had to be slackened, literally to allow
the men to snatch a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proportion in the Royal Artillery of killed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>wounded was very great. According to the records of the
2nd Battalion, the list was even heavier than that given by
Drinkwater in his celebrated work; but even accepting the
latter version as correct, it stood as follows:—</p>

Artillery in Gibraltar, and commissioned in 1780; who
enjoyed his honours for a very short time, being killed in the
bombardment of the 13th of September, 1782. The officers
who were wounded were Major Lewis, Captain-Lieutenant
Seward, Lieutenants Boag, Willington, Godfrey, and Cuppage.
Of these, Lieutenant Boag was twice wounded during
the siege. He, like Captain Reeves, had commenced his
service as a matross; nor was his promotion accelerated
by brevet or otherwise on account of his wounds, in the
dull times of reduction and stagnation, which followed the
peace signed at Versailles in 1783. He was at last appointed
Major in 1801. Retiring two years later, after a service of
forty-five years, he died, as he had lived, plain James Boag,—unnoticed,
forgotten, as the great siege itself was, in the
boiling whirl which was circling over Europe, fevering
every head and heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two valuable inventions were made during the siege by
Artillery officers, to increase the efficacy of their fire. By
means of one, a gun could be depressed to any angle not
exceeding 70°—a most important invention in a fortification
like Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other discovery—if it may be called so—was in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>opposite direction. The nightly bombardment, in 1781, by
the enemy's gunboats not merely caused great damage and
loss of life, but also an annoyance and irritation out of
proportion to the injury inflicted. Governor Eliott resolved
to retaliate in similar fashion, and to bombard the Spanish
camp, which it was hoped to reach by firing from the Old
Mole Head. On it was placed a 13-inch sea-service mortar,
fired at the usual elevation but with a charge of from
twenty-eight to thirty pounds of powder; and in the sand
alongside, secured by timber, and at an angle of 42°, five
32-pounders and one 18 pounder were sunk, and fired with
charges of fourteen and nine pounds of powder respectively.
The results were most satisfactory,—alarming and annoying
the enemy, and in proportion cheering the garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was impossible that a siege of such duration could continue
without the importance and responsibility of Artillery
officers becoming apparent. This fact produced an order
from the Governor, which saved them from much interference
from amateur Artillerymen in the form of Brigadiers.
The officers commanding in any part of the Fort were forbidden
to interfere with the officers of Artillery in the
execution of their duty, nor were they to give orders for
firing from any of the batteries without consulting the
officer who might happen to be in charge of the Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The life of the garrison during this weary siege was, as
might be expected, monotonous in the extreme. The distress
undergone, the want of provisions felt by all ranks,
from the self denying Governor downwards;—the hoping
against hope for relief;—the childish excitement at every
rumour which reached the place;—the indignation at what
seemed a cruel, unnecessary, and spiteful bombardment;—and
the greater fury among the troops, when, among other
results of the enemy's fire, came the disclosure in the
damaged houses and stores of the inhabitants, of large
quantities of wine and provisions, hoarded through all the
time of scarcity, in the hope that with still greater famine
the price they would bring would be greater too;—all these
are told with the minuteness of daily observation, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>work from which all accounts of the siege are more or less
drawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The marvellous contentment with which the troops bore
privations, which they saw were necessary; the good-humour
and discipline they always displayed, save on the
occasion just mentioned, when anger drove them into marauding,
and intoxication produced its usual effect on troops;
the extraordinary coolness and courage they displayed during
even the worst part of the bombardment, a courage which
was even foolhardy, and had to be restrained; all these make
this siege one of the noblest chapters in England's military
history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the blockade commenced in 1779, it was April,
1781, before the bombardment from the Spanish lines, which
drove the miserable townspeople from their houses for shelter
to the south of the Rock, can be said to have regularly commenced.
When it did commence, it did so in earnest; shells
filled with an inflammable matter were used, which set the
buildings on fire; and a graphic description of a bombarded
town may be found in Drinkwater's pages. "About noon,
Lieutenant Budworth, of the 72nd Regiment, and Surgeon
Chisholme, of the 56th, were wounded by a splinter of a
shell, at the door of a northern casemate in the King's
Bastion. The former was dangerously scalped, and the
latter had one foot taken off, and the other leg broken,
besides a wound in the knee.... Many
casks of flour were brought into the King's Bastion, and
piled as temporary traverses before the doors of the southern
casemates, in which several persons had been killed
and wounded in bed.... In the course of
the day, a shell fell through the roof of the galley-house,
where part of the 39th and some of the 12th Regiments
were quartered; it killed two, and wounded four privates....
In the course of the 20th April, 1781, the
Victualling Office was on fire for a short time; and at
night, the town was on fire in four different places....
On the 21st, the enemy's cannonade continued
very brisk; forty-two rounds were counted in two minutes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>The Garrison Flag-staff, on the Grand Battery, was so much
injured by their fire, that the upper part was obliged to be
cut off, and the colours, or rather their glorious remains,
were <em>nailed</em> to the stump.... On the
23rd, the wife of a soldier was killed behind the South
Barracks, and several men wounded....
On the 24th, a shell fell at the door of a casemate in the
King's Bastion, and wounded four men <em>within</em> the bomb-proof....
The buildings at this time
exhibited a most dreadful picture of the results of so
animated a bombardment. Scarce a house north of Grand
Parade was habitable; all of them were deserted. Some
few near Southport continued to be inhabited by soldiers'
families; but in general, the floors and roofs were destroyed,
and only the shell left standing....
A shell from the gunboats fell in a house in Hardy Town,
and killed Mr. Israel, a very respectable Jew, with Mrs.
Tourale, a female relation, and his clerk....
A soldier of the 72nd Regiment was killed in his bed by a
round shot, and a Jew butcher was equally unfortunate....
The gunboats bombarded our camp about
midnight, and killed and wounded twelve or fourteen....
About ten o'clock on the evening of 18th
September, a shell from the lines fell into a house opposite
the King's Bastion, where the Town Major, Captain Burke,
with Majors Mercier and Vignoles, were sitting. The
shell took off Major Burke's thigh; afterwards fell through
the floor into the cellar—there it burst, and forced the
flooring, with the unfortunate Major, to the ceiling. When
assistance came, they found poor Major Burke almost
buried among the ruins of the room. He was instantly
conveyed to the Hospital, where he died soon after....
On the 30th, a soldier of the 72nd lost both
his legs by a shot from Fort Barbara....
In the afternoon of the 7th October, a shell fell into a
house in town, where Ensign Stephens of the 39th was
sitting. Imagining himself not safe where he was, he
quitted the room to get to a more secure place; but just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>as he passed the door, the shell burst, and a splinter
mortally wounded him in the reins, and another took off
his leg. He was conveyed to the Hospital, and had suffered
amputation before the surgeons discovered the mortal
wound in the body. He died about seven o'clock....
In the course of the 25th March, 1782, a shot
came through one of the capped embrasures on Princess
Amelia's Battery, took off the legs of two men belonging
to the 72nd and 73rd Regiments, one leg of another soldier
of the 73rd, and wounded another man in both legs; thus
four men had seven legs taken off and wounded by one
shot."</p>

<p class='c000'>And so on, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>. The daily life was like this;
for although even worse was to come at the final attack,
this wearying, cruel bombardment went on literally every
day. On the 5th May, 1782, the bombardment ceased
for twenty-four hours, for the first time during thirteen
months.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in the time of great pestilence, after the first alarm has
subsided, there is a callous indifference, which creeps over
those who have escaped, and among whom the familiarity
with Death seems almost to have bred contempt, so—during
this long siege—after the novelty and excitement of the first
few days' bombardment had worn off, the men became so indifferent
to the danger, that, when a shell fell near them,
the officer in charge would often have to compel them to
take the commonest precautions. The fire of the enemy
became a subject of wit even, and laughter, among the men;
and probably the unaccustomed silence of that 5th of May,
when the bombardment was suspended, was quite irksome to
these creatures of habit, whose favourite theme of conversation
was thus removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the incidents of the bombardment, there was one
which demands insertion in this work, as the victim—a
matross—belonged to the Royal Artillery. Shortly before
the bombardment commenced, he had broken his thigh;
and being a hearty, active fellow, he found the confinement
in hospital very irksome. He managed to get out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>ward before he was cured, and his spirits proving too much
for him, he forgot his broken leg, and falling again, he was
taken up as bad as ever. While lying in the ward for the
second time under treatment, a shell from one of the gunboats
entered, and rebounding, lodged on his body as he lay,
the shell spent, but the fuze burning. The other sick men
in the room summoned strength to crawl out of the ward
before the shell burst; but this poor fellow was kept down
in his bed by the weight of the shell, and the shock of the
blow, and when it burst, it took off both his legs, and
scorched him frightfully. Wonderful to say, he survived a
short time, and remained sensible to the last. Before he
died he expressed his regret that he had not been killed in
the batteries. Heroic, noble wish! While men like these
are to be found in the ranks of our armies, let no man
despair. Heroism such as this, in an educated man, may be
inspired by mixed motives—personal courage, hope of being
remembered with honour, pride in what will be said at home,
and, perhaps, a touch of theatrical effect,—but, in a man like
this brave matross, whose courage has failed even to rescue
his name from oblivion, although his story remains—the
heroism is pure and simple—unalloyed, and the mere expression
of devotion to duty, for duty's sake. And this
heroism is god-like!</p>

<p class='c000'>This was but one of many heroic actions performed by
men of the Royal Artillery. Another deserves mention, in
which the greatest coolness and presence of mind were displayed.
A gunner, named Hartley, was employed in the
laboratory, filling shells with carcass composition and fixing
fuzes. During the operation a fuze ignited, and "Although
he was surrounded by unfixed fuzes, loaded shells, composition,
&amp;c., with the most astonishing coolness he carried
out the lighted shell, and threw it where it could do little
or no harm. Two seconds had scarcely elapsed, before it
exploded. If the shell had burst in the laboratory, it is
almost certain the whole would have been blown up—when
the loss in fixed ammunition, fuzes, &amp;c., would have been
irreparable—exclusive of the damage which the fortifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>would have suffered from the explosion, and the lives
that might have been lost."<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yet again. On New Year's Day, 1782, an officer of Artillery
in Willis's Batteries, observing a shell about to fall near
where he was standing, got behind a traverse for shelter.
The shell struck this very traverse, and <em>before</em> bursting, half
buried him with the earth loosened by the impact. One
of the guard—named Martin—observing his officer's position,
hurried, in spite of the risk to his own life when the shell
should burst, and endeavoured to extricate him from the
rubbish. Unable to do it by himself, he called for assistance,
and another of the guard, equally regardless of personal
danger, ran to him, and they had hardly succeeded in extricating
their officer, when the shell burst and levelled the
traverse with the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>This great siege of Calpe, the fourteenth to which the
Rock had been subjected, divides itself into three epochs.
First, the monotonous blockade, commencing in July, 1779;
second, the bombardment which commenced in April,
1781; and third, the grand attack, on the 13th September,
1782.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blockade was varied by occasional reliefs and reinforcements;
and was accompanied by an incessant fire from
the guns of the fortress on the Spanish works. The batteries
most used at first were Willis's, so called (according to an old
MS. of 1705, in the Royal Artillery Record Office), because
the man who was most energetic, when these batteries were
first armed, bore that name. When the attacks from the
gunboats commenced, the batteries to the westward—the
King's Bastions and others—were also employed. The steady
fire kept up by the Artillery, its accuracy, and the improvements
in it suggested by the experience of the siege, were
themes of universal admiration; and the many ingenious
devices, some of them copied by the enemy, by which, with
the assistance of the Engineers, they masked, strengthened,
and repaired their batteries, form a most interesting study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>for the modern Artilleryman. The incessant Artillery duel,
which went on, made the gunners' nights as sleepless frequently
as their days; for the hours of darkness had to be
devoted to repairing the damages sustained during the day.
Well may the celebrated chronicler of the siege talk of them
as "our brave Artillery,"—brave in the sense of continuous
endurance, not merely spasmodic effort.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the siege of Belleisle, described in a former chapter,
the failing ammunition of the enemy was indicated by the
use of wooden and stone projectiles. The latter were used
by the Royal Artillery at Gibraltar, but for a different
reason. To check and distract the working-parties of the
enemy, shell had been chiefly employed by the garrison;
and the proficiency they attained in the use of these projectiles
can easily be accounted for, when it is remembered
how soon and how accurately every range could be ascertained;
how eager the gunners were to make every shot tell;
and how exceedingly important it was to check the continued
advance of the enemy's works. For variety's sake, it
would seem, for there was no need to economize shell at this
time—in pure boyish love of change, the Artillerymen devised
stone balls, perforated so as to admit of a small
bursting-charge, and a short fuze; and it was found that
the bursting of these projectiles over the Spanish working-parties
caused them incredible annoyance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the fire of the garrison during the first epoch of
the siege was the most important consideration, and its
value could hardly be overrated, as to it alone was any hope
due of prolonging the defence until help should come from
England,—it was not the only distinctive feature of this
time. It was during the blockade that the garrison was
most sorely tried by the scarcity of food. And in forming
our estimate of the defence of Gibraltar, it should never be
forgotten that the defenders were always the same—unrelieved,
without communication with any back country; and
with hardly any reinforcements to ease the heavy duties. The
97th Regiment, which arrived during the siege, was long in
the garrison before it was permitted, or indeed was able, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>take its share of duty; and the hard work, as well as the
hard fare, fell upon the same individuals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The statistics, given so curtly by Drinkwater, as to the
famine in the place, enable us to realize the daily privations
of the troops. At one time, scurvy had so reduced the
effective strength of the garrison, that a shipload of lemons
which arrived was a more valuable contingent than several
regiments would have been. In reading the account of this,
with all the quiet arguments as to the value of lemon-juice,
and its effect upon the patients, one cannot but wish, that in
every military operation there were artists like Drinkwater
to fill in the details of those pictures, whose outlines may be
drawn by military commanders, or by the logic of events, but
whose canvas becomes doubly inviting through the agency
of the other industrious and unobtrusive brush. Modern
warlike operations suffer from an overabundance of description;
but the skeleton supplied by official reports, and the
frequent flabbiness of those rendered by newspaper correspondents,
produce a result far inferior to the compact
picture presented by a writer at once observant and professional.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a table, at the end of Drinkwater's work, crowded out
of the book, as if hardly worthy of mention, and yet most
precious to the student now, we find some of the prices paid
for articles of food during the siege. Fowls brought over a
guinea a couple; beef as much as 4<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em> per pound; a
goose, 30<em>s.</em>; best tea as high as 2<em>l.</em> 5<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per pound; eggs,
as much as 4<em>s.</em> 10½<em>d.</em> per dozen; cheese, 4<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em> per pound;
onions, 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per pound; a cabbage, 1<em>s.</em> 7½<em>d.</em>; a live pig,
9<em>l.</em> 14<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em>; and a sow in pig, over 29<em>l.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>The high price, at times, of all vegetables, was an index
of the existence of that terrible scourge—scurvy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some very quaint sales took place. An English cow was
sold during the blockade for fifty guineas, reserving to the
sellers a pint of milk each day while she continued to give it;
while another cow was purchased by a Jew for sixty guineas,
but in so feeble a state, that she dropped down dead before
she had been removed many hundred yards. The imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>fails in attempting to realize the purchaser's face—a
Jew, and a Gibraltar Jew; but can readily conceive the
laugh against him among the surrounding crowd, their
haggard faces looking more ghastly as they smiled. Although
Englishmen take their pleasure sadly, they also
bear their troubles lightly. An English soldier must be
reduced indeed, ere he fails to enjoy a joke at another
man's expense, and this characteristic was not wanting
at Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second epoch—the Bombardment—was at first hardly
believed to be possible. The fire of the garrison was directed
against an assailant and a masculine force; but a bombardment
of Gibraltar meant—in the minds of its defenders—a
wanton sacrifice of women and children; a wholesale murder
of unwarlike inhabitants, who could not escape, and to whom
the claims of the conflicting Powers were immaterial. The
wailing of women over murdered children, of children over
wounded parents; the smoking ruins of recently happy
homes; the distress of the flying tradespeople and their
families, seeking safety to the southward of the Rock, and
abandoning their treasures to bombardment and pillage; all
these told with irritating effect upon the troops of a country
whose sons are chivalrous without being demonstrative. In
days coming on—in terrible days which many who read
these pages may have lived in and seen, English troops shall
clench their hands, and set their teeth with cruel hardness,
as they come upon little female relics—articles of jewellery
or dress—perhaps even locks of hair, scattered in hideous
abandonment near that well at Cawnpore, whose horrors
have often been imagined—never told. To those who have
seen this picture, the feelings of the beleaguered garrison in
Gibraltar will be easily intelligible, as they stumbled in the
town over a corpse—and that corpse a woman's. No wonder
that when the great sally took place, historical as much for
its boldness as its success, there was an angry desperation
among the troops, which it would have taken tremendous
obstacles to resist. It was a brave morning, that 27th of
November, 1781, when "the moon's nightly course was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>"nearly run,"<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> and ere the sun had risen, a little over 2000
men sallied forth to destroy the advanced works of the
enemy—an enemy 14,000 strong—and works, three-quarters
of a mile from the garrison, and "within a few hundred yards
of the enemy's lines, which mounted 135 pieces of heavy
artillery."<a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The officers and men of the Royal Artillery
who took part in the sortie, numbered 114; and were
divided into detachments to accompany the three columns
of the sallying force, to spike the enemy's guns, destroy their
magazines and ammunition, and set fire to their works. It
was the last order issued in Colonel Tovey's name to the
brave men whom he had commanded since the promotion of
Colonel Godwin. For Abraham Tovey was sick unto death;
and as his men were parading for the sortie, and the moon
was running her nightly course—his was running fast too.
Before his men returned, he was dead. For nearly half a
century he had served in the Royal Artillery—beginning his
career as a matross in 1734, and ending it as a Lieutenant-Colonel
in 1781. He died in harness—died in the command
of a force of Garrison Artillery which has never been surpassed
nor equalled, save by the great and famous siege-train
in the Crimea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The troops for the sortie paraded at midnight, on the Red
Sands, under Brigadier-General Ross. They consisted of the
12th Regiment, and Hardenberg's—two which had fought
side by side at Minden—and the Grenadiers and light infantry
of the other regiments. There were also, in addition to the
Artillery, 100 sailors, 3 Engineers, with 7 officers and 12 non-commissioned
officers, overseers, 40 artificers, and 160 men
from the line as a working party. A reserve of the 39th
and 58th Regiments was also in readiness, if required.</p>

<p class='c000'>On reaching the works, "The ardour of the assailants was
irresistible. The enemy on every side gave way, abandoning
in an instant, and with the utmost precipitation, those
works which had cost them so much expense, and employed
so many months to perfect....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The exertions of the workmen, and the Artillery, were
wonderful. The batteries were soon in a state for the fire
faggots to operate; and the flames spread with astonishing
rapidity into every part. The column of fire and smoke
which rolled from the works, beautifully illuminated the
troops and neighbouring objects, forming altogether a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'œil</span></i> not possible to be described. In an hour, the
object of the sortie was fully effected."<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The third epoch, culminating in the grand attack on the
13th September, 1782, is deeply interesting. The fate of
Minorca had released a number of Spanish troops, to act
against Gibraltar; and large French reinforcements had
arrived. On the land side, there were now "Most stupendous
and strong batteries and works, mounting two hundred
pieces of heavy ordnance, and protected by an army
of near 40,000 men, commanded by a victorious and active
general, the Duke de Crillon; and animated by the immediate
presence of two Princes of the Royal Blood of
France." From the sea, the Fort was menaced by forty-seven
sail of the line:—"Ten battering-ships, deemed
perfect in design, and esteemed invincible, carrying 212
guns; besides innumerable frigates, xebeques, bomb-ketches,
cutters, gun and mortar-boats, and smaller craft
for disembarking men."<a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was during the bombardment immediately preceding
the grand attack, that Major Lewis was wounded, and
Lieutenant Boag received his second wound, the latter in a
singular manner. He was in the act of laying a gun, when
a shell fell in the Battery. He immediately threw himself
into an embrasure for safety when the shell should explode;
but when the shell burst, it <em>fired the gun under
whose muzzle he lay</em>. Besides other injury, the report deprived
him of hearing, and it was very long ere he recovered.
Another officer of the Artillery, Major Martin, had a narrow
escape at the same time, a 26-pounder shot carrying away
the cock of his hat, near the crown.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>The 26-pounder was a very common gun, both in the
Rock and in the enemy's land-batteries; but as it was not
used on board their ships, and to prevent them returning
the shot of the garrison against themselves, all the 26-pounders
were moved to the seaward batteries, and fired
against the ships, guns of other calibres being employed
against the land forces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battering ships, with their supposed impregnable
shields, were the mainstay of the enemy's hopes; but the
use of red-hot shot by the garrison made them after a time
perfectly useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the cannonade was at its highest pitch, on the day
of the grand attack, "the showers of shot and shell which
were directed from the enemy's land-batteries, the battering-ships,
and, on the other hand, from the various
works of the garrison, exhibited a scene of which, perhaps,
neither the pen nor pencil can furnish a competent idea.
It is sufficient to say that four hundred pieces of the
heaviest Artillery were playing at the same moment: an
instance which has scarcely occurred in any siege since
the invention of those wonderful engines of destruction."<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At first the battering-ships seemed to deserve their reputation.
"Our heaviest shells often rebounded from their
tops, whilst the 32-pound shot seemed incapable of making
any visible impression upon their hulls.... Even
the Artillery themselves at this period had their doubts of
the effect of the red-hot shot.... Though so vexatiously
annoyed from the Isthmus, our Artillery totally
disregarded their opponents in that quarter, directing their
sole attention to the battering-ships, the furious and
spirited opposition of which served to excite our people
to more animated exertions. A fire, more tremendous, if
possible, than ever was therefore directed from the garrison.
Incessant showers of hot balls, carcasses, and shells
of every species flew from all quarters; and as the masts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of several of the ships were shot away, and the rigging of
all in great confusion, our hopes of a speedy and favourable
decision began to revive."<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Towards evening, signs of great distress and confusion
were visible on board the ships, and the Admiral's ship was
seen to be on fire. But not until next morning did the garrison
realize how great was their advantage. In the meantime
the fire was continued, though less rapidly; and "as
the Artillery, from such a hard-fought day, exposed to the
intense heat of a warm sun, in addition to the harassing
duties of the preceding night, were much fatigued; and as
it was impossible to foresee what new objects might
demand their service the following day; the Governor
about six in the evening, when the enemy's fire abated,
permitted the majority of the officers and men to be relieved
by a piquet of a hundred men from the Marine
Brigade; and officers and non-commissioned officers of the
Artillery were stationed on the different batteries, to direct
the sailors in the mode of firing the hot shot."<a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>During the night, several of the battering-ships took fire,
and the scenes on board were terrible. Next day "three
more blew up, and three were burnt to the water's edge;"
and of the only two remaining, one "unexpectedly burst out
into flames, and in a short time blew up, with a terrible
report," and the other was burnt in the afternoon by an
officer of the English navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The exertions and activity of the brave Artillery," says
Drinkwater, "in this well-fought contest, deserve the highest
commendations.... The ordnance and carriages
in the Fort were much damaged; but by the activity of
the Artillery, the whole sea-line before night was in serviceable
order.... During this action the enemy
had more than three hundred pieces of heavy ordnance in
play; whilst the garrison had only eighty cannon, seven
mortars, and nine howitzers in opposition. Upwards of
8300|rounds, more than half of which were hot-shot, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>716 barrels of powder, were expended by our Artillery....
The distance of the battering-ships from the
garrison was exactly such as our Artillery could have
wished. It required so small an elevation that almost
every shot took effect."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 13th, the day of the attack, Captain Reeves and
five men of the Royal Artillery were killed: Captains Groves
and Seward, and Lieutenant Godfrey, with twenty-one men,
were wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, indeed, as Carlyle says, a "Doom's-blast of a No,"
which the Artillery of Gibraltar answered to the summons
of this grand attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the failure of the attack, the enemy did not discontinue
their old bombardment, nor did the gunboats fail to
make their nightly appearance, and molest the inhabitants
longing for rest. The Governor accordingly directed the
Artillery to resume the retaliation from the Old Mole Head
with the highly-elevated guns against the enemy's camp.
The command of the Royal Artillery now lay with Colonel
Williams, an officer who joined the service as a cadet-gunner
in 1744, and died at Woolwich in 1790.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work of the Artillery in the interval between the
grand attack and the declaration of peace was incessant, day
and night.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 2nd February, 1783, exchange of shots ceased;
and letters were sent by the Spanish to the Governor announcing
that the preliminaries of peace were signed at
Paris. From this date, courtesies were constantly exchanged.
It was on the occasion of a friendly visit of the Duke de
Crillon to the Fort, that on the officers of Artillery being
presented to him he said, "Gentlemen! I would rather see
you here as friends, than on your batteries as enemies,
where you never spared me."</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege had lasted in all three years, seven months,
and twelve days; and during this time the troops had
well earned the expressions used with regard to them by
General Eliott, when he paraded them to receive the thanks
of the Houses of Parliament,—"Your cheerful submission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>to the greatest hardships, your matchless spirit and exertions,
and on all occasions your heroic contempt of every
danger."</p>

<p class='c000'>To the Artillery, for their share in this matchless defence,
there came also the commendation of their own chief, the
Master-General of the Ordnance, then the Duke of Richmond.
The old records of the Regiment seem to sparkle and shine
as one comes on such a sentence as this:—"His Majesty has
seen with great satisfaction such effectual proofs of the
bravery, zeal, and skill by which you and the Royal Regiment
of Artillery under your command at Gibraltar have
so eminently distinguished yourselves during the siege;
and particularly in setting fire to, and destroying all the
floating batteries of the combined forces of France and
Spain on the 13th September last."</p>

<p class='c000'>There was so much in the Peace of 1783 that was painful
to England, not so much in a military as in a political point
of view, but undoubtedly in the former also, that one hesitates
to leave this bright spot in the history of the time, and
to turn back to that weary seven years' catalogue in America,
of blunders, dissensions, and loss. It was one and the same
Peace which celebrated the salvation of Gibraltar, and the
loss of our American Colonies. A strong arm saved the one:
a foolish statesmanship lost the other. But be statesmen
wise or foolish, armies have to march where they order; and
the history of a foolish war has to be written as well as that
of a wise one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was October, 1783, ere the companies of the Royal
Artillery which had been present at the Great Siege returned
to Woolwich on relief. The next active service they saw
was in Egypt in 1801, when three of them, Nos. 1, 2, and 4
Companies of the Second Battalion, were present with Abercromby's
force at the Battle of Alexandria, and during the
subsequent operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>To serve in one of these companies is to serve in one whose
antecedents as Garrison Artillery are unsurpassed. Their
story is one which should be handed down among the officers
and men belonging to them: for they have a reputation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>maintain, which no altered nomenclature can justify them in
allowing to become tarnished.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no fear of courage being wanting; but the standard
from which there should be no falling away is that of conduct
and proficiency, worthy of the old proficiency maintained
under such harsh circumstances, and of the old conduct which
shone so brightly in the "cheerful submission to the greatest
hardships."</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> military importance of the capture of Minorca from
the English in 1782 was not, perhaps, such as to warrant
a separate chapter for its consideration. But the defence
of St. Philip's Castle by the English against the combined
forces of France and Spain was so exceptionally gallant, their
sufferings so great, and the zeal and courage of the Artillery,
especially, so conspicuous, that something more than a passing
mention is necessary in a work of this nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege lasted from the 19th August, 1781, to the 5th
February, 1782. General Murray was Governor, and Sir
William Draper, Lieutenant-Governor. The strength of the
garrison at the commencement of the siege was 2295 of all
ranks; at the end of the siege, this number had been reduced
to 1227, but so many of these were in hospital, that the whole
number able to march out at the capitulation did not exceed—to
use the Governor's own words—"600 old decrepit soldiers,
200 seamen, 170 of the Royal Artillery, 20 Corsicans,
25 Greeks, Moors, &amp;c."</p>

<p class='c000'>In a postscript to the official report of the capitulation the
Governor says:—"It would be unjust and ungrateful were
I not to declare that from the beginning to the last hour
of the siege, the officers and men of the Royal Regiment
of Artillery distinguished themselves. I believe the world
cannot produce more expert gunners and bombardiers than
those who served in this siege." This alone would make
imperative some notice of this siege in a narrative of the
services of the Corps.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Castle of St. Philip's, there were at the commencement
of the siege 234 guns and mortars. At the end, no less
than 78 of these had been rendered unserviceable by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>enemy's fire. The batteries were almost demolished, and
the buildings a heap of ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following officers of the Royal Artillery were present:</p>

<p class='c031'>Major <span class='sc'>Walton</span>.</p>

<p class='c031'>Captains: <span class='sc'>Fead</span>, <span class='sc'>Lambert</span>, <span class='sc'>Schalch</span>, <span class='sc'>Parry</span>, and <span class='sc'>Dixon</span>.</p>

<p class='c031'>First Lieutenants: <span class='sc'>Irwin</span>, <span class='sc'>Woodward</span>, <span class='sc'>Lemoine</span>, <span class='sc'>Neville</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Bradbridge</span>.</p>

<p class='c031'>Second Lieutenants: <span class='sc'>Hope</span>, <span class='sc'>Wulff</span>, and <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the Artillery the garrison was composed of
two Regiments of British, and two of Hanoverian troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The commandant of the enemy's forces was the Duke de
Crillon, the same officer who after the capitulation of St.
Philip's proceeded to command at the Siege of Gibraltar. He
drew upon himself a well-merited rebuke from General
Murray, whom he had endeavoured to bribe, with a view to
the immediate surrender of the Castle; a rebuke which he
felt, and answered with great respect and admiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is in the Royal Artillery Record Office a journal
kept during the siege by Captain F. M. Dixon, R.A., from
which the following details are taken, many of which would
lose their force if given except in the writer's own words.
The siege commenced on the 20th August, when there was
nothing but confusion and disorder within St. Philip's, to
which the troops had retired; but the enemy did not commence
firing on the Castle until the 15th September. The
English had not been so quiet; they commenced firing at a
great range on the 27th August, and with great success.
At the request of the Duke de Crillon, all the English families
had been sent out, in humane anticipation of the intended
bombardment. Desertion from the enemy was frequent at
first; and as the siege progressed it was occasional from the
British troops. When a deserter was captured, he received
no mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most deadly enemy of the garrison was scurvy. Hence
an order on the 7th November, 1781, for an officer and six
men per company to be told off daily to gather pot-herbs on
the glacis. Anything of a vegetable nature brought a fabulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>price; tea was sold at thirty shillings a pound; the
number of sick increased every day, the men concealing their
illness to the last rather than go to hospital, and very
frequently dying on duty from sheer exhaustion:—"Our
people," says the diary, "do more than can be expected,
considering their strength; the scurvy is inveterate....
108 men fell sick in two days with the scurvy....
I am sorry our men are so very sickly; our
people fall down surprisingly, we have not a relief....
The Hanoverians die very fast: there is no fighting
against God.... Our troops increase vastly in
their sickness;" and so on. Among those who fell a
victim during the siege was Captain Lambert, of the
Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>So heavy were the duties that even the General's orderly
sergeants were given up to diminish the burden; and when
the capitulation was resolved upon, it was found that while
the necessary guards required 415 men, there were only 660
able to carry arms, leaving, as the Governor said, no men for
piquet, and a deficiency of 170 men to relieve the guard.
Against this small force, entrenched in what was now a mere
heap of rubbish, there was an enemy, whose lowest number
was estimated at 15,000, and was more likely 20,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the enemy's batteries were armed with 13-inch
mortars. When the British ammunition ran short, the
shells of the enemy which had not burst were returned to
them, and in default of these, stone projectiles were used
with much effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 12th December, 1781, the following batteries had
been opened against the Castle:—</p>

<p class='c000'>But the above list does not exhaust the number which
ultimately directed their fire on the Castle. New batteries
were prepared without intermission, hemming in with a
deadly circle the devoted garrison. Some extracts from
Captain Dixon's diary will give some idea of the fire to which
the place was subjected:—</p>

<p class='c000'>January 6th, 1782. "A little before seven o'clock this
morning they gave three cheers and fired a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joie</span></i>;
then all their batteries fired upon us with great fury, which
was equally returned by our brave Artillery. Our General
declared he had never seen guns and mortars better served
than ours were."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 7th, 1782. "Such a terrible fire, night and day,
from both sides, never has been seen at any siege. We
knew of 86 brass guns and 40 mortars against us....
Our batteries are greatly demolished; it is with great
difficulty that we can stand to our guns."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 9. "All last night and this day they never
ceased firing, and we as well returned it. You would have
thought the elements were in a blaze. It has been observed
they fire about 750 shot and shell every hour. Who
in the name of God is able to stand it? We hear they
have 200 guns in their park."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 10. "The enemy had 36 shells in flight at the
same time. God has been with us in preserving our people:
they are in high spirits, and behave as Englishmen. Considering
our small garrison, they do wonders. Our Generals
constantly visit all the works.... A great
number of shells fell within the limits of the Castle....
A shell fell in the General's quarters, wounded
Captain Fead of the Artillery, and two other officers."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 11. "The enemy keep up, if possible, a fiercer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>fire than yesterday. A man might safely swear, for six
days past, the firing was so quick that it was like a proof
at Woolwich of 200 cannon. About a quarter past six, the
enemy began to fire shells, I may say innumerable."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 19. "Never was Artillery better served, I may
say in favour of our own corps."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 20. "This night shells meet shells in the air.
We have a great many sick and wounded, and those that
have died of their wounds.... Our sentries have
hardly time to call out, 'A shell!' and 'Down!' before
others are at their heels."</p>

<p class='c000'>January 24. "The Artillery have had hard duty and are
greatly fatigued. The scurvy rages among our men."</p>

<p class='c000'>The casualties among the small garrison, between the 6th
and 25th of January, 1782, included 24 killed, 34 died, 71
wounded, and 4 deserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>January 28, 1782. "They fire shot and shell every
minute. The poor Castle is in a tattered and rotten condition,
as indeed are all the works in general....
The Castle and every battery round it are so filled by the
excavations made by the enemy's shells, that he must be a
nimble young man who can go from one battery to another
without danger. The Castle, their grand mark, as well as
the rest of the works, are in a most shocking plight."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 4th February, a new and powerful battery of the
enemy's, on a very commanding situation, being ready to
open fire, a white flag was hoisted, the drums beat a parley,
and an officer was sent out with the proposed terms of capitulation;
which were ultimately amended and agreed to.
By the second Article of the Treaty, "in consideration of the
constancy and valour with which General Murray and his
garrison have behaved by their brave defence, they shall
be permitted to march out with shouldered arms, drums
beating, matches lighted, and colours flying, until they get
towards the centre of the Spanish troops." This was done
at noon on the following day, between two lines of the Spanish
and French troops. So pitiable and deplorable was the appearance
of the handful of men who marched out that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>conquerors are said to have shed tears as they looked at them.
In the official report of General Murray, he alludes to this,
saying that the Duke de Crillon averred it to be true. When
the men laid down their arms, they declared that they surrendered
them to God alone, "having the consolation that
the victors could not plume themselves upon taking a
hospital."</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Schalch was the senior officer of Artillery left to
march out at the head of the dwindled and crippled remnant
of the three companies. Of them, and their comrades of the
other arms, the Governor said in a final General Order, dated
at Mahon, 28th February, 1782, that he had not words to
express his admiration of their brave behaviour; and that
while he lived he should be proud of calling himself the
father of such distinguished officers and soldiers as he had
had the honour to command.</p>

<p class='c000'>So ended the Train of Artillery for Port Mahon, which
the reader will remember was one of those quoted in 1716
as a reason for some permanent force of Artillery at home.
Since 1709, with a short interval in the time of the Seven
Years' War, a train had remained in Minorca; but now, overpowered
by numbers, the force of which it was a part had to
evacuate the island. It was a stirring time for the Foreign
establishments, as they were called in pre-regimental days:
that in Gibraltar was earning for itself an immortal name;
those in America were within the clouds of smoke and war
which covered the whole continent; and this one had just
been compelled to die hard. Of the four, which were used
as arguments for the creation of the Royal Regiment of
Artillery, only one remains at this day—that at Gibraltar.
Those at Annapolis and Placentia have vanished before the
breath of economy, and the dawn of a new colonial system;
and in this brief chapter may be learnt the end of the other,
the Train of Artillery for service at Port Mahon.</p>

<p class='c014'><em>N.B.</em>—It is worthy of mention, that during this siege, three non-commissioned
officers, Sergeants-Major J. Swaine, J. Shand, and J. Rostrow, were
commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the Regiment, by the Governor,
for their gallantry. They were afterwards posted to the Invalid Battalion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <span class='sc'>The American War of Independence.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>There</span> are few campaigns in English history which
have been more systematically misunderstood, and
more deliberately ignored, than the American War between
1775 and 1783. The disadvantages under which the British
troops laboured were many and great; they were not merely
local, as in most English wars, but were magnified and intensified
by the unpopularity of the campaign at home, by
the positive hostility of a large party, including some of the
most eloquent politicians, and by the inflated statements of
the Government, which made the tale of disaster—when it
came to be known—more irritating and intolerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soldiers will fight for a nation which is in earnest: British
soldiers will even fight when they are merely the police
to execute the wishes of a Government, instead of a people.
But in the one case they are fired with enthusiasm,—in the
other, their prompter is the coldest duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The American War was at once unpopular and unsuccessful.
When it was over, the nation seemed inspired by a
longing to forget it; it was associated in their minds with
everything that was unpleasant; and the labour of searching
for the points in it which were worthy of being treasured
was not appreciated. English historians have always been
reluctant to pen the pages of their country's disasters; and
their silence is at once characteristic of, and thoroughly
understood by, the English people. There has, however, been
a species of self-denying ordinance laid down by English
writers, and spouted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad nauseam</span></i> by English speakers, in
which the whole blame of this war is accepted almost greedily
and its losses painted in heightened colours as the legitimate
consequences of national error. England <em>was</em> to blame—taxation
without representation undoubtedly is unjust; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>were American motives at the outset pure? It may readily
be granted that after the first shedding of blood the resistance
of the colonists was prompted by a keen sense of injury
such as might well animate a free and high-spirited people;
but, before the sword was drawn, the motives of the Boston
recusants no more deserve to be called worthy, than the
policy of England deserves to be called statesmanship.</p>

<p class='c000'>England, with the name, had also the responsibilities of
a mighty and extended empire. Her colonies had the name
and the advantages, without the responsibilities. The parent
was sorely pressed and heavily taxed, to protect the children;
the children were becoming so strong and rich that they
might well be expected to do something for themselves.
The question was "How?" It is only just to say that when
the answer to the question involved the defence of their own
soil by their own right hand, no more eager assistants to the
Empire could be found than our American colonists. But
when they were asked to look beyond their own shores, to contribute
their share to the maintenance of the Empire elsewhere—perhaps
no bad way of ensuring increased security for themselves—the
answer was "No!" They would shed their blood
in defence of their own plot of ground; but they would not
open their purses to assist the general welfare of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonial difficulty in more recent times has been met
by presenting to the colonies the liberty desired by the old
American provinces, but at the same time throwing on them to
a great extent the duty of their own defence. It is a mere
suspension of the difficulty, well enough in theory, but which
must break down in practice. While the parent has the sole
power of declaring war, and of involving in its area distant
children, innocent and ignorant of the cause, she can no
more throw off the duty of their defence than she can bury
herself beneath the waves that chafe her coasts. But, for
the present, it affords a tolerable compromise. In the
future, unless our rulers can spare time from the discussion
of such petty measures as the Ballot, for the consideration
of a question which involves the national existence, the
Colonial Question is as certain again to face us as a difficulty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>as it did in 1775. Then, the system which seemed most
natural to the rulers of England was to accept the duty of the
Empire's defence, but to insist on the colonies contributing
to the cost. Unwise as this step was, the colonies being
unrepresented in the Taxing Body, it might have been borne,
had it not interfered with certain vested, although ignoble
rights. The collection of the new revenue required imperial
cruisers to enforce it: and these vessels sorely interfered
with the habits and customs of the merchants of Massachusetts,
who were the most systematic smugglers. With
what petty matters are the beginnings of great revolutions
entwined! The sensuality of Henry VIII. was a means to
the religious reformation of England: the selfishness of the
Boston traders was the note which raised in America the
thirst for independence. It is an easy thing to raise a cry
which shall at once carry with it the populace, and yet smother
the real issues. And this was done in Boston. Up to
the commencement of military operations, it is difficult to
say which is the least enticing subject for contemplation, the
blind, unreasoning, unaccommodating temper of the English
Government, or the selfish, partisan, ignoble motives of those
who were really the prime movers of the Revolution, although
soon dwarfed and put out of sight by the Frankenstein
which their cunning had called into existence. It is almost
a relief to the student, when the sword is drawn: he has
then to deal with men, not schemers; he has then pictures
to gaze at of an earnest people fighting for independence,
or, on the other hand, an outnumbered army fighting
for duty; and he has then such figures to worship as that
purest and noblest in history, George Washington, for the
proper revelation of whose character the losses of that war's
continuance may be counted to all time as a clear gain.
What a grim satire it reads as one finds this god-like man a
puppet in the hands of those who were as incapable of understanding
his greatness as of wielding his sword! Wellington
in Spain, worried by departmental idiocy in England, was an
object of pity, but his troubles are dwarfed by those under
which a weaker man than Washington would have resigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>in disgust. It is pleasant to read of the gallant way in which
the Royal Artillery acquitted itself in the American War:
but no encomium from an English General has greater value
than that of Washington, who urged his own Artillery to
emulate that of his enemy: and in all the satisfaction which
such praise from Washington, as an enemy, must beget, there
is mingled a feeling of pride that it should have been in a
school of war, where Washington was a comrade, instead of
an enemy, that he had taken the first lessons in the science
of which he proved so great a master.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be regretted that the silence of the one country's
historians on the subject of the American War is not compensated
by the undoubted loquacity and grandiloquence of
the other's. The student is equally baffled by the former,
and bewildered by the latter. Perhaps the pride and boasting
of the young country is natural: perhaps it was to be expected
that ere long the fact would be forgotten that without
the assistance of France and Spain to distract England,
their independence could never have been achieved; but
when coupled with this forgetfulness, comes an exaggeration
of petty encounters into high-sounding battles, and of
defeats like that of Bunker's Hill into something like
victories, to be celebrated by national monuments, the
student may smile complacently at the enthusiasm of the
conquerors, but must regret the dust which is thrown in his
eyes by their boasting and party-feeling.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are fortunately two comparatively temperate writers,
who were contemporary with the war, and took part in it on
opposite sides, Stedman and Lee,—the latter being the
officer who commanded the celebrated Partisan Legion (as it
was called), on the American side; and in endeavouring to
arrive at the truth as to the war, the student cannot do
better than adhere to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The war, like the siege of Gibraltar, divides itself into
epochs. The first, and most northerly, embraces Massachusetts
and Canada; the second concentrates itself round New
York, with the episode of Saratoga; and the third and last,
derives its main interest from the operations in the South,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>culminating in the disastrous capitulation of Yorktown.
In tracing the services of the Artillery during the various
stages, we shall have a glimpse of nearly every operation of
importance which occurred during the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the 4th Battalion was not the only representative
of the Royal Artillery in America during the war—the
1st and 3rd Battalions also being represented—its commanding
officers, Colonels Cleaveland and Pattison, who
served on the Staff of the Army as Brigadiers, were in
command of the Artillery on the Continent; and, therefore,
in tracing the services of the corps, the records of the
4th Battalion form the best groundwork. When hostilities
commenced, in Massachusetts, the head-quarters of the battalion
were in Boston. General Gage, who commanded
the troops, had failed to conciliate the colonial representatives.
On the 25th February, 1775, he sent a party of
infantry and marines to seize some guns which he understood
were in the town of Salem; but on their arrival, they
found that the guns had been removed. On the evening of the
18th April, in the same year, he sent a similar body—about
900 strong—to the town of Concord on a like errand, and
here the first blood of the war was shed. Great mismanagement
was displayed on the part of the English commander,
and a very decided hostility on the part of the colonists,
ultimately rendering a retreat necessary. The troops commenced
retiring on Lexington, under an incessant, although
irregular fire from the militia and peasantry; and luckily, on
their arrival at that town, they met a reinforcement under
Lord Percy, sent to their assistance, and accompanied by
two field-guns. This was the first appearance of the Royal
Artillery in the war. Under the fire of the guns, the troops
were able to continue their retreat comparatively unmolested;
but before they reached Boston, they had sustained
a loss of no less than 273 killed, wounded, and prisoners.
This number was considered sufficient to justify the
Americans in honouring the conflicts which occurred, by the
high-sounding titles of the "Battles of Concord and Lexington."
Effective as the fire of the English guns was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>complaints were made, probably in self-defence, by the commanding
officer of the troops, that the Artillery were inadequately
supplied with ammunition on the occasion. A
strong remonstrance was immediately addressed by Colonel
Cleaveland to the Master-General of the Ordnance, stating
the true facts. "I find it has been said in England, that
ammunition was wanting for the two guns which went
with the Brigade to Lexington—that they had only 24
rounds per gun. I had a waggon with 140 rounds on the
parade, and Lord Percy refused to take it, saying it might
retard their march, and that he did not imagine there would
be any occasion for more than was on the side boxes."<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the 17th June, 1775, the Battle of Bunker's Hill, as it
is called, although Breed's Hill was the real scene of operations,
(Bunker's Hill, which was intended to be fortified,
being considerably more distant from Boston,) was fought;
and in the batteries on Cop's Hill, and with the guns
actually on the field, five companies of the 4th Battalion
were present—Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8. Eight field-guns were
actually in action; but twelve accompanied the attacking
force—four light 12-pounders, four 5½-inch howitzers, and
four light 6-pounders. The attack was made under the fire
of the guns, "The troops advancing slowly, and halting at
intervals to give time for the Artillery to produce some
effect."<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> In these words, the recently exploded traditions
are apparent, which wedded the Artillery to the infantry
during an engagement, instead of allowing it independent
action. One statement is made by Stedman, generally a
most accurate writer, which it is difficult to reconcile with
Colonel Cleaveland's official report. "During the engagement,"
writes the former, "a supply of ball for the
Artillery, sent from the Ordnance Department in Boston,
was found to be of larger dimensions than fitted the
calibres of the field-pieces that accompanied the detachment;
an oversight which prevented the further use of the
Artillery." In opposition to this statement, Colonel Cleaveland's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>report to the Master-General may be quoted. "At
Bunker's Hill, I sent sixty-six rounds to each gun, and not
more than half was fired."<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Had the reason been that
given by Stedman, Colonel Cleaveland was too truthful a
man to omit mentioning it. The Battle of Bunker's Hill
was the Inkermann of the American War. The British lost
1054 killed and wounded; the enemy admitted a loss of 449.
The latter had the advantage of an elevated and entrenched
position; the former fought in heavy marching order—on a
hot summer day—and had to ascend a steep hill in the face
of a heavy and continuous fire. The loss fell most heavily
on those who met hand to hand; the Artillery met with but
little casualty. According to the 4th Battalion records,
Captain-Lieutenant Lemoine, Lieutenant Shuttleworth, and
nine matrosses were wounded; according to Colonel Cleaveland's
MSS., this number was increased by Captain Huddlestone,
whom he includes among the wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The English plan of attack was faulty, and the defence of
the Americans was admirable; but these facts merely rendered
the victory of the English troops more creditable.
It was a barren victory—perhaps, even, an injurious one. It
did not save Boston from the blockade, which from this day
became more thorough, and it certainly encouraged the
American militia, who found with what effect they could
fight against those regular troops from whom they had
hitherto shrunk a little, with a species of superstitious dread.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was not the less a complete victory, a soldiers'
victory, by sheer hard and close fighting; and, even more, an
officers' victory—for at one time nothing but the energy
and gallantry of the officers would have rallied the troops,
reeling under a tremendous fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime, the rebels or patriots, as they were
called respectively by enemies and friends, resolved to invade
Canada. Nos. 3 and 6 Companies of the 4th Battalion
were scattered over the provinces, and on the lakes, in detachments.
On the 3rd May, 1775, a small body of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Americans, (who had already possessed themselves of artillery,)
attacked with success Crown Point and Ticonderoga.
In November, the posts of Chambly and St. John were also
taken, and with the exception of one officer and eight men,
the whole of No. 6 Company was now captive, and remained
so until exchanged on the 7th April, 1777. Two
men belonging to the company were killed at St. John. The
capture of these posts placed at the disposal of the Americans
a quantity of guns, ammunition, and stores, of which they
had stood sorely in need: and the supply was largely increased
by the fortunate capture of an ordnance transport
from Woolwich, heavily laden with a valuable cargo.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 25th September, an ill-judged and unsuccessful
attack was made on Montreal by a small force of rebels, in
which their commander was taken prisoner; but later in
the year—a more formidable demonstration being made
by a force under General Montgomery—the Commandant,
General Carleton, withdrew to Quebec: and Montreal fell
into the enemy's hands. Part of No. 3 Company was made
prisoner on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege of Quebec was the next episode in the Canadian
part of the war. It was totally unsuccessful; and the
gallant commander of the Americans—General Montgomery,
who had fought under Wolfe at the same place—was killed.
The Artillery present in Quebec belonged to No. 3 Company,
4th Battalion; but they were very few in number.
They were under the command of Captain Jones, whose
services on the occasion received the highest praise. A sort
of blockade of the town was kept up by General Montgomery's
successor—Arnold,—but it was indifferently conducted;
and as soon as a man-of-war was able to get up
through the ice, General Carleton sallied out and routed the
American forces in a most thorough manner. Very little
more was done in Canada during the war. The loyalty of
the inhabitants was unmistakable; and it cannot fail to
surprise one who remembers for how very brief a time the
French Canadians had been under British rule. Even later
in the war, when the French fleet came to render active
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>assistance to the Americans, and the Admiral appealed to
the French colonists to rise, his appeal was unsuccessful.
Either the British rule had already become popular, because,
on the whole, kind and just; or the sympathies of the
French Canadians—although, perhaps, not with the English—were
still more averse from the American cause, which
was associated in their minds with the old New England
enemies who had waged with them such an incessant
border-warfare. The loyalty of Canada is one of the
marvels of English history. It seems unalienable, as it
certainly is unselfish. Tested, sixteen years after its conquest,
by the great American War; and again in the present
century by the second American War; tried sorely by a
too paternal Colonial Office, which retarded its advancement,
its hindrance made all the more plain by the spectacle,
across the frontier, of the American Republic attaining a
marvellous wealth and development; exposed to risk from
enemies whom it did not know, and in quarrels in which it
had no share, merely on account of its connection with
England; suffering, without indemnity, loss of life and of
treasure by invasion from lawless banditti, who thought to
strike England through her dependency; chilled by neglect,
and depressed by words which, if they had any meaning at
all, insinuated that she was a burden to the parent, and half
suggested to her to take her leave, and to quit the Empire of
which she had been so staunch a member;—tested, tried,
endangered, suffering, and neglected, the loyalty of Canada
remains undimmed. It is, as has been said, a marvel! Let
England take heed that she do not underrate this treasure
of a people's tried affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime, while Canada had been invaded by the
rebels, their army, under Washington, had gradually surrounded
Boston, and established a very thorough blockade—causing
great hardship and suffering to the troops. On the
2nd and 3rd of March, 1776, they established batteries to
the east and west of the town, which the Royal Artillery
vainly endeavoured for fourteen days to silence; and ultimately
it was decided to evacuate Boston, and retire to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Halifax, Nova Scotia, to prepare for an attack upon New
York later in the year, and with large naval and military
reinforcements from England.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evacuation of Boston was conducted in good order,
and without loss. Washington ceased firing on the troops,
on receiving notice from the English general—Howe—that
if the bombardment continued, he would set fire to the town,
to cover his retreat; and the men, guns, and stores, were
placed on board the transports with regularity, and without
interruption—but not without great labour. Colonel Cleaveland
reported to the Board of Ordnance, that on the evening
of the 6th March, 1776, he had received orders to use every
despatch to embark the Artillery and stores. "The transports
for the cannon, &amp;c., which were ordered to the wharf,
were without a sailor on board, and half stowed with
lumber. At the same time, most of my heavy cannon,
and all the Field Artillery, with a great quantity of ammunition,
was to be brought in from Charleston, and other
distant posts. I was also obliged to send iron ordnance to
supply their places, to keep up a fire on the enemy, and
prevent their breaking ground on Forster Hill. On the
fifth day, most of the stores were on board, with the exception
of four iron mortars and their beds, weighing near
six tons each. With great difficulty I brought three of
them from the battery, but on getting them on board the
transport, the blocks gave way, and a mortar fell into the
sea, where I afterwards threw the other two....
Two of my transports were manned with four
marines, and a few Artillery, who understand something
of sailing." The guns which were left in the town were
the oldest, and were left for use, if necessary, in covering
the final embarkation of the troops. One hundred and fifty
vessels were employed in transporting the army and its
stores to Halifax; and with the army were Nos. 1, 2, 4,
5, and 8 Companies of the 4th Battalion, Royal Artillery,
under Colonel Cleaveland, who, having recently received the
Army rank of Colonel, received also now the local rank of
Brigadier. During the last few months of his stay in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Boston, he had been much occupied in planning the Artillery
share in the coming summer campaign, and in making the
necessary demands on the authorities at home. He obtained
permission to purchase 700 horses at Halifax and Annapolis;
and a remonstrance made by him about the "wretches whom
he had to hire as drivers" at two shillings per day, succeeded
in procuring for him a draft of trained drivers from
England. Four companies of the 3rd Battalion had joined
before he left Boston, but not before he was sorely in need
of their services, for he literally had not a relief for the men
whom he had to keep constantly on duty. Two more companies
were ordered from England to the South; four
companies under Colonel Phillips were ordered to Canada, to
take part ultimately in Burgoyne's wild expedition; and two
more were embarked for service along the coast in bomb-vessels.
A large number of 3-pounders, mounted on wheel-carriages
devised by Captain Congreve, had arrived, and a
larger number was promised. They were found infinitely more
convenient than those Colonel Cleaveland already had, and
arranged so as to be carried on the backs of horses and mules.
Captain Congreve's ingenuity displayed itself in many ways,
and called forth repeated expressions and letters of praise
and commendation from Colonel Cleaveland. Doubtless the
favourable reports made by that officer did much to procure
for him—in 1778—from Lord Townsend, then Master-General
of the Ordnance, the new appointment of Founder
and Commandant of the Royal Military Repository. The
grounds attached to that institution are now used solely
for instruction in the management of heavy ordnance, but
when it was first opened, the sharp turns and steep inclines
in the roads of the Repository Grounds were made use of
in training the drivers to turn and manage their horses.
Captain Congreve—afterwards Sir William Congreve—was
a very distinguished and able Artillery officer, but it was
not he, but his son, who invented the well-known Congreve
rocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officer who went in command of the companies of
Artillery ordered for service in the South was Major Innes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>an officer who commenced his career as a matross, and ended
it as Commandant of the Invalid Battalion in 1783.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel James commanded the detachments on board the
bombs, and was much praised for the accuracy of his fire
at the unsuccessful attack on Fort Sullivan, near Charlestown,
South Carolina, in June, 1776. He also commenced
his career as a matross—in the year 1738—and died as a
Colonel Commandant, in 1782.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several cadets were sent out to fill vacancies as they might
occur, instead of promoting non-commissioned officers. While
doing duty, awaiting these vacancies, they received pay as
Second Lieutenants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the guns sent out for the campaign of 1776 were
some light 24-pounders with travelling carriages, some 12-pounders,
an immense number of light 3-pounders with
Congreve's carriages, and some mortars for pound-shot. It
was intended by the English Government, that this campaign
should be decisive; and the fleet, army, and Artillery
were very powerful. Lord Howe commanded the fleet, and
his brother commanded the army; and they had full powers
to treat with the rebels with a view to a cessation of hostilities,
provided they should submit. The army left Halifax
in June, 1776, and landed on Staten Island on the 3rd July;
the whole of the Artillery being disembarked by the 7th of
the month. Here they were joined by Sir Henry Clinton's
forces from the South, and by Lord Howe and his fleet
from England. A large force of Hessians and Waldeckers
also joined them; and on the 22nd August, the army crossed
to Long Island without molestation. The Americans were
encamped at the north end of the island, where the city of
Brooklyn now stands—protected behind by batteries, on the
left by East River, and on the right by a marsh. A range
of wooded hills separated the two armies, the passes being
in the possession of the rebels. On the 27th, the Battle
of Long Island—or Battle of Brooklyn, as it is indifferently
called—was fought. The share taken by the Artillery in
this victory, was—owing to the nature of the ground, and
the hurried retreat of the Americans within their lines—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>small. There were forty guns present: six with Lord
Cornwallis's brigade; fourteen with General Clinton in the
van; ten with the main body under Lord Percy; and four
12-pounders with the 49th Regiment in rear. The loss
consisted of but three killed—Lieutenant Lovell, a sergeant,
and a bombardier. So difficult were the 3-pounder guns on
truck carriages found either to be moved or carried, that
Brigadier Cleaveland sent them on board ship, and replaced
them with those mounted on Congreve's carriages. From
the loyalist farmers on Long Island, an additional hundred
horses were bought for the Artillery, and eighty two-horse
waggons, with drivers, hired for the conveyance of ammunition
and stores.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the greatest blots on Sir William Howe's generalship
was his omission to follow up the victory he won on
Long Island. Had he done so, his troops being flushed with
victory, and the enemy being disheartened and disunited, it
is possible that he might have put an end to the war. By
means of his apathy or neglect, Washington's troops were
able to cross over to New York unmolested. Before attacking
New York, the English commander considered it desirable
to destroy a very strong redoubt, at a place called Hell
Gate, mounted with a considerable number of guns to prevent
communication, should it be attempted by the British
troops, from the East River into the Sound. Four batteries
were accordingly erected by the Royal Artillery on the opposite
shore, mounting three 24-pounders, three heavy and
three medium 12-pounders, and ten small mortars. As it
eventually happened, the landing of the British in New
York was made at a spot where the Hell Gate redoubt would
have been useless; but it was satisfactory to find, on entering
it afterwards, the enemy's guns dismounted, and the
works so shattered, that the troops might have marched in
with little or no impediment. In the Brigadier's report on
this occasion, he said, "The distance was near 700 yards,
and though the enemy threw a number of shells from six
mortars, we had only on this occasion two men killed, and
one lost an arm. It is with infinite satisfaction that I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>say, that whenever the Artillery is employed, they have
not only the approbation of the Commander-in-Chief, but
the whole army, for their behaviour."</p>

<p class='c000'>The British landed on Manhattan Island, under the fire of
the ships; and in the precipitate retreat to the heights of
Haarlem, the Americans lost their artillery, and many stores,
and Washington nearly despaired of ever succeeding with
such troops as he had under his command. But it was not
enough to obtain possession of New York, unless the rebel
forces could be dislodged from the powerful position they
occupied in the north of the island; and to do this, an engagement
on no small scale was necessary, and was commenced
on the 27th October, 1776. Its opening was called
the Battle of the White Plains; and viewing it from the
Artillery point of view, it may be described as follows (bearing
in mind that it was only the opening scene of a series of
engagements, all intimately connected, and resulting in the
scattering of Washington's forces, their expulsion from New
York Island, and almost from the Jerseys; the capture of
Forts Washington and Lee, and the complete command of
the Lower Hudson):—The attack of the 27th October on the
White Plains commenced with a cannonade on the enemy's
left wing, with nearly thirty guns, manned by the Royal
Artillery. On the 28th, the attack of the Hessian troops
was covered by six light 12-pounders; and General Knyphausen
publicly thanked the officers and men who were
attached to them. In the attack on Fort Washington in the
beginning of November, the Royal Artillery had thirty-four
guns in action to cover the troops. The Guards and Light
Infantry who were engaged in the attack crossed the East
River in boats under the protection of batteries erected for the
purpose. The hill they had to ascend from their landing
was exceedingly rugged and steep, and the boats in which
they crossed were exposed to the fire of two of the American
batteries. To silence these, the batteries above-mentioned
were built, and armed with four medium 12-pounders, fourteen
light 6-pounders, four howitzers, and two mortars.
With this armament, the rebel fire was soon silenced, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the exception of one 3-pounder, which was sheltered by a
rock, and which did considerable damage. A battalion of
the rebel forces which was marching for the defence of the
hill was also entirely broken and dispersed by the well-directed
fire of the Royal Artillery, under which the Guards
and Light Infantry landed, and gained the hill without
losing a man. The 42nd Regiment, which landed at another
place, was covered by four 6-pounders; and six guns advanced
with Lord Percy, from the lines at New York, and
gained the heights of Haarlem, every gun being engaged.
In this attack, the Artillery is described as having been
powerful and well-served; officers and men received public
acknowledgment in General Orders, and from the Master-General;
and in answering the latter's commendations,
Brigadier Cleaveland felt justified in saying: "The officers
and men under my command have shown an unwearied
application to the service, and deserve everything I can say
in their favour.... The good opinion your
Lordship is pleased to form of the conduct and superior
abilities of the British Artillery when engaged, does them
the highest honour, and I have the pleasure to inform your
Lordship, that both officers and men have been emulous
during the course of the campaign in deserving it."</p>

<p class='c000'>The attack on the fort was too powerful to be resisted; so
it capitulated. Lord Cornwallis, with a large body of men
immediately crossed the North River, to attack Fort Lee,
but it was abandoned by its garrison on the 18th November,
and all the guns and stores fell into the hands of the
English.</p>

<p class='c000'>The English now overran the Jerseys, and the following
guns were present with the Royal Artillery during the raid:
four light 12-pounders, fourteen 6-pounders, eight 3-pounders,
and two 5½-inch howitzers. This was a very
critical period for the American cause, almost as much so as
after the Battle of Long Island. "During these operations,
the New York Convention was greatly alarmed lest the
numerous forces (<em>i.e.</em> loyalists) of the State should rise
in arms, and openly join the British forces. Often obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>by the movements of the armies to change its locality, that
body sat successively at Haarlem, King's Bridge, Philip's
Manor, Croton River, and Fishkill; some of the time, to
guard against surprise, with arms in their hands. A committee
was appointed for inquiring into, detecting, and
defeating conspiracies. That committee had funds at its
disposal, a special armed force, and unlimited powers.
Many Tories were seized by its orders and sent into Connecticut
for safe-keeping, their personal property being
forfeited to the use of the State.... Some
of the New York Militia (in Washington's camp) refused
to do duty. They were offered—they said—peace, liberty,
and safety, and what more could they ask."<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> While not
underrating the energy of a people who could attain their
end in spite of such difficulties, it is healthy reading occasionally,
in the midst of flabby orations as to the uprising
of a united people, to examine passages like that just
quoted. A large substratum of loyalty existed yet, which
had to be kept down by a sort of reign of terror; and although,
as we shall see, the loyal diminished greatly in
numbers as the war went on, the fact remains that the rebellion
was not a national conception, but a party manœuvre,
which secured by dexterous management the assistance
of many pure and noble men, and ultimately—assisted by
war—received the co-operation of the mass of the people.
The war bound the people together by an instinct of self-defence,
apart from the reasons which had brought it about;
and once committed to a cause, men are as ingenious in
inventing, often unconsciously, arguments in its favour, as
they are enthusiastic in defending their opinions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gloom of the American cause in the end of 1776 was
brightened by a surprise of some German troops at Trenton,
by Washington, who took the whole prisoners, to the
number of about 1000. This success did much to re-animate
the rebels, and gave a new life to their prosecution of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year 1777 was destined to be the most eventful year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of the whole campaign. The British had formed a plan,
whose aim was as good as its execution was foolish. Prior,
however, to its commencement, Washington made an attack
on two regiments, the 17th and 55th, near Princeton, which
is described in Brigadier Cleaveland's despatch to the Board
of Ordnance in the following words:—"The most particular
action that has happened since Washington's recrossing
the Delaware, was an attack made by him with 4000 men,
upon the Battalion of the 17th Regiment at Princeton, in
which action the 17th has gained great honour, and their
Lieutenant-Colonel, Mawhood, great reputation. The heavy
fire of the enemy at the first of the attack obliged the
Regiment to retire, under cover of four 6-pounders advantageously
posted. Here the Regiment formed, and made a
general charge upon the enemy, whom they forced wherever
they advanced, leaving a piece of cannon behind them.
Colonel Mawhood observing the enemy increasing greatly
in their numbers, thought proper to march from Princeton,
where we were obliged to leave two 6-pounders, all the
horses belonging to the guns being shot, and the axletree
of the other carriage broke by firing." At this affair,
Lieutenant Desaguliers, and nine men of the Royal Artillery
were killed. These active movements of Washington had
the effect of making both General Howe and Lord Cornwallis
withdraw their forces from Trenton and Princeton,
and spend the rest of the winter near New York,—on Long
Island, and in the neighbouring parts of New Jersey.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan of operations formed by the British Commanders
under instructions from home is well and succinctly described
by the American writer, Lee: "It contemplated the
annihilation of resistance in all the country between
the Lakes and Albany; undisturbed possession of the
Hudson River (thus severing the Union), and the conquest
of Pennsylvania, whose capital (Philadelphia) was the metropolis
of the American States." To carry out this plan,
it was resolved that one British army should march from
Canada, and another from New York, whose meeting would
complete the separation of the Eastern from the Western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>States, north of New York. Two blunders were committed
in this scheme. The first was the appointment of General
Burgoyne to command the northern force, instead of
General Carleton, who was well acquainted with the country;
the second was the employment of a northern army at all.
New York was in English hands, and the mastery of the sea
was as yet undisputed. Had New York been made the base
of operations, and an army been sent up the Hudson, with
its communications with New York maintained by the navy,
the separation of the States would have been assured. But
when General Burgoyne with his 7000 men left Canada,
and plunged into the American forest, he cut his communications
with the base of his operations, and his case became
more hopeless every mile he advanced. That it was not want
of gallantry, but infamous strategy, which brought on the
Sedan-like Convention of Saratoga, may be seen by the most
cursory study, and is eloquently acknowledged in the following
words by Lee, who, though an enemy, was not blind to
the courage of his opponents:—"Where is the General who
ever more prodigally risked his life in his country's cause,
than the unfortunate Burgoyne? Where the army which
more bravely executed its leader's will, than did that
which he conducted? What danger was avoided? What
effort unessayed? What privation not submitted to?
What difficulties not encountered? But all terminated in
disaster; and the army, from whose prowess so much was
expected, yielded to its equal in courage, to its superior in
number." The American army, under General Gates, was
a little over 13,000 strong; Burgoyne's force did not exceed
5700|at the date of the capitulation.
The interest to the Artilleryman, in the details of this
expedition, is unaffected by its disastrous termination. From
commencement to termination, order-books,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> despatches, and
regimental records, speak in terms of enthusiasm of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>courage of the Artillery, and their gallant commander—Major-General
Phillips—who, although only a Regimental
Major, held the higher Army rank by brevet, and was second
in command of the whole force. Of the service of the
Artillery at the Battle of Stillwater, Cust, in his 'Annals of
the Wars,' writes, "The Artillery did wonders;"—and of the
retreat of the 7th October, the same author says, "Phillips
and Riedesel were now ordered to cover the retreat, and the
troops retired, hard pressed, but in good order; the Artillery,
under Major Williams, doing good execution, but <em>all</em>
the horses having been disabled, six of the guns were
obliged to be abandoned." Stedman, in his account of
the Battle of Stillwater, says, "During the action, Major-General
Phillips contrived to convey through a thick part
of the wood, some British Artillery, which was of essential
service. Captain Jones of this corps, who fell in this
action, was particularly distinguished." But the most
valuable comment is that made by General Phillips himself,
after the termination of the campaign; in a report made
by him from Albany on the 22nd October, 1777, to Lords
Townsend and Amherst. "I have to report to you, my
Lords, that the Corps of Artillery which I commanded has
acted during the campaign with the greatest spirit, and
has received the entire approbation of General Burgoyne,
and the applause of the army. In the action of the 19th
September, the Artillery was of infinite use; and a brigade
commanded by Captain Jones, with Lieutenants Hadden and
Reid, was particularly engaged, and maintained their post
to the last, although in doing of it <em>every man, except five,
was either killed or wounded</em>. Captain Jones was killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In the affair of October 7th, Major Williams kept a battery
in action, until the Artillery horses were all destroyed, and
his men either killed or wounded; being unable to get off
their guns, he was surrounded and taken, with two officers,
Lieutenants York and Howorth, the latter wounded. Captain
Blomefield, my Major of Brigade, was also wounded on
the 7th instant, at Major Williams' battery. I cannot sufficiently
commend the activity, zeal, and spirit of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>officers. The same gallant spirit remained to the last day,
when the Convention was signed. I had the honour to
deliver a message to the Lieutenant-General from the
Corps of Artillery, that they were as ready as ever to
undergo any hardships, or to undertake any difficulties, for
the King's service. Under this description, allow me to
recommend the corps to your Lordship's protection, and
humbly request that you will represent their conduct to
His Majesty." The men of the Irish Artillery, who were
referred to in a former chapter as having taken part in the
American War, formed part of the force under General
Phillips, and it was to their conduct during this expedition
that allusion was made by the Master-General in the despatch
there quoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of this disastrous expedition is short and
simple. Having left his Canadian quarters in June, Burgoyne
invested Ticonderoga on the 1st July, captured it on
the 6th, pursued the flying garrison with gunboats on the
lakes, as well as in forced marches by land, and utterly scattered
them. Leaving the lakes in the end of July, he
marched for the Hudson; but as he already felt the want of
supplies, it was the 13th of September before he crossed that
river, and took up his position at Saratoga. On the 19th
September, the Battle of Stillwater was fought—in which
the English were left masters of the field—the 9th, 20th,
21st, 24th, 47th, and 62nd Regiments being engaged, and
behaving with the greatest valour. On the 7th of October,
a forward movement made by Burgoyne was defeated, and
it was during his retreat on that day that—as stated above—Major
Williams' battery behaved so well. Affairs were
now desperate: the Indians were deserting, and the enemy
increasing in numbers every day; supplies of all sorts were
short, nor was there any means of obtaining them; the
actually effective British troops did not exceed 3500; and
there was an opposing force, said to amount to 16,000 men:
there was no appearance of the long-expected army from
New York under Sir Henry Clinton; and even if Burgoyne
succeeded in retreating to Canada, he might greatly embarrass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Clinton, by enabling Gates' and Washington's armies
to unite; but retreat became soon impossible. At last, with
only three days' provisions left, he opened negotiations with
General Gates, and on the 17th the Convention was signed,
and this wild, baseless expedition met its natural and disastrous
termination.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the signal in Europe for action among England's
enemies. From this day, France and Spain made
no secret of their resolution to join the Americans; and to
this extraneous evil was added the indignation of the English
people with the Government. Even those who opposed
the war were indignant with the authorities: ready critics,
although backward in assistance. The affair at Trenton was
more valuable, as far as the Americans themselves were concerned:
it came at a time of great depression, and reanimated
their drooping spirits: but as far as other nations
could judge, the surrender of Burgoyne was most important,
and decided two at least to take an active instead of
a passive share in the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the mean time what were the troops doing at New
York? And in the first place, what were Colonel Cleaveland,
and the companies under his command, doing? They were
becoming sadly diminished in numbers, and the theme of
all Colonel Cleaveland's letters was the same—a cry for more
men from England. "The demand for Artillerymen," he
wrote "is so great that the smallest body of infantry wish
not to move without them. I must therefore entreat your
Lordship to give us every possible addition to our Corps....
From the small number of Artillerymen
in quarters, and no assistance to be had from the army,
I am obliged to hire seamen to act as labourers, and find
they do more work than any other men I can employ."</p>

<p class='c000'>At the very time he was writing thus, he was being
pressed by the Commander-in-Chief to increase the number of
guns for the field during the summer campaign; to form
batteries of iron 24-pounders and brass 12-pounders on
travelling carriages; and to buy as many horses as he could,
instead of trusting to those which were pressed for service as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>required. His patience and the wants of the army being
unable to wait for the deliberate movements of the English
Ordnance officials, he at last obtained permission from the
Commander-in-Chief to enlist three hundred men in New
York, "although," he wrote, "these will be very insufficient
to man the cannon for the field,—and we therefore most
ardently wish for more Artillery from England." He
clothed the recruits with the last year's clothing for the 4th
Battalion, demanding an additional supply from England in
its room. By the correspondence of this time, it appears
that the men had no greatcoats except a few for use on
sentry, which were kept in the guard rooms. The severity
of the winter made it necessary to demand a supply, as the
men were much exposed. This appeal was made in the year
1777, and was granted in the year 1786—the matter having
taken nine years to penetrate the official brain. Even then
it was only granted in part—to the extent of ten per company,
increased two years later to fifteen, as the idea
became more comprehended by the authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the 1st of June, 1777, an extra supply of four hundred
horses was obtained; the batteries were all ready, and by
the middle of the month the campaign commenced. The
object of Sir William Howe was to draw off Washington from
a strong position which he held, enabling him to prevent his
opponents from rendering assistance to Burgoyne, and also
from advancing on Philadelphia. Every feint was attempted
without success; and at last the British General resolved on
a genuine invasion of some part south of New York, which
would compel Washington to move. During the month of
June, only one engagement of any importance took place,
at Westfield, between the British under Lord Cornwallis and
3000 Americans under Lord Stirling, in which the latter
were defeated with a loss of three guns. At this action, the
detachments of Artillery who were present belonged to the
4th Battalion. By the way, a peculiar service for the Royal
Artillery to perform is mentioned by Stedman as having been
carried out on the 6th July in this year. "The American
galleys were destroyed near Skenesborough during Burgoyne's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>expedition by Captain Carter, of the Artillery, who
commanded a Brigade of <em>gunboats</em>. He gave chase, and
pursued them with such speed, that he captured several of
their largest galleys, and obliged them to set the remainder
on fire with a considerable number of their bateaux."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 23rd July 1777, Sir William Howe embarked his
army—leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York—and
sailed for the south. Until the 22nd August he kept his
intended destination a secret, and baffled Washington's
speculations, but on that day news came that he had entered
Chesapeake Bay, so the American General marched to meet
him. On the 25th August Howe disembarked his troops,
and marched inland. To prevent the English reaching Philadelphia,
the Americans who had been within a very few miles
of their enemies, fell back, and occupied the heights beyond
the Brandywine river. On the 11th, the English attacked
the American position, moving in two columns, one under
Lord Cornwallis, the other under General Knyphausen. The
former column crossed the river at an unexpected point, and
mounting the hill under a heavy protecting fire of Artillery
drove the Americans into the woods. General Knyphausen
had some severe fighting also, and ultimately succeeded in
getting across.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the Battle of Brandywine, in which the Americans
admitted a loss of 300 killed, 600 wounded, and 400 prisoners,
besides 11 pieces of Artillery. The English had 8 officers
and 74 men killed, and a little over 400 wounded. The
Royal Artillery lost 5 killed—Lieutenant Shand, 2 sergeants,
and 9 rank and file wounded. A small engagement, equally
favourable to the British, and in which the 42nd and 44th
Regiments greatly distinguished themselves, took place on
the 18th September, and on the 25th Lord Cornwallis took
possession of Philadelphia. Writing from that city on the
28th November to Lord Germaine, Sir William Howe said,
"Much credit is due to Brigadier-General Cleaveland and to
the officers and men of the Corps of Artillery."</p>

<p class='c000'>While in Philadelphia, Brigadier Cleaveland heard that he
was to be superseded by Brigadier Pattison who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>appointed to the 4th Battalion <em>vice</em> Colonel Ord, who had died
in the preceding April. The first time that General Pattison
is mentioned as having taken active part in the war was on the
22nd October, 1777, when the British troops took possession
of the Fort of Red Back—on which occasion he commanded
the Artillery: but General Cleaveland had not ceased to do
duty, for he commanded the Artillery at the successful attack
on Mud Island on the 16th November, an attack which
succeeded in "removing all the obstacles to the free navigation
of the Delaware by the British fleet."<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>After Lord Cornwallis had entered Philadelphia, and while
the great body of the British troops were encamped under
Sir William Howe, at a village called Germantown, about six
miles from Philadelphia, Washington made a sudden attack
upon them early in the morning of the 4th October. Although
at first successful, it did not long continue so. Failure of
punctual co-operation, according to Lee's account, and the
brave stand made by the 40th Regiment, soon changed the
current of events: and Washington was ultimately obliged
to retire with a loss of at least 1000 killed, wounded, and
prisoners. In speculating on the causes of this defeat, Lee
uses language such as few other American writers would use,
and such as few living Americans would care to hear. But
it is perhaps all the more valuable. "The defeat must be
attributed," he says, "to the yet imperfect discipline of the
American army: to the broken spirit of the troops, who,
from day to day, and from month to month, had been subjected
to the most trying and strength-wasting privations,
through the improvidence or inability of Government: to
the inexperience of the tribe of generals, and to the complication
of the plan of assault—a complication said to
have been unavoidable."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was before superior numbers that the British evacuated
Boston: to superior numbers Burgoyne surrendered at
Saratoga: and now the superiority of numbers being in the
other direction, the Americans were defeated in every action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>during this part of the campaign. Defeated, but, it must be
admitted, not disheartened, for the losses round Philadelphia
were forgotten in the blaze of triumph which accompanied
the capitulation of Burgoyne's force; and the growing intensity
of the American feeling will be realized from a letter,
which will be quoted in the next chapter, written in the
very place where their losses must have been most palpably
real.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was necessary to throw up field-works round the British
camp, which after the battle of Germantown was brought
nearer Philadelphia, and also to erect works to secure the command
of the river. The Artillerymen were largely employed
in building and arming these; and one of them was the scene
of a gallant action on the part of a detachment, which is
mentioned both by Stedman and Lee, and also appears in
the MS. Record Book of the 4th Battalion. According to
the last-mentioned authority, some detachments of Nos. 4, 5,
and 8 Companies were employed in constructing batteries on
Provence Island, in the Delaware, for the reduction of an
American post on Mud Island, when a party of the 10th
Regiment, under Major Vatap, which covered the works,
abandoned them on the advance of the enemy, and the whole
of the guns fell into their hands, but owing to the gallantry
of the detachment of Artillery, the enemy was obliged
to retire, the guns were retaken, and the batteries again
occupied. Stedman in telling this circumstance mentions
that the Artillerymen were under the command of a
subaltern, to whose gallantry the recapture of the batteries
was due: and Lee adds, "I believe this conduct of Major
Vatap (who abandoned most shamefully the Artillery) is
the single instance of dastardly conduct among the British
officers during the war."</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir William Howe spent the winter at Philadelphia with
his army—of which eight companies of the Royal Artillery
formed part. The same hesitation or dilatory disposition
which prevented him following up his successes on Long
Island induced him to spend many valuable months in idleness
now. France and America had now formed an alliance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>it was very important that energetic action should be taken
by the British troops in America before the arrival of the
French fleet. But the opportunity was lost by the supineness
of Sir William Howe; and although he was a man who had
endeared himself to his troops, there can be no doubt that
when he resigned the command in May, 1778, and was
succeeded by Sir Henry Clinton, he was replaced by one who
was equal to him as a soldier, and far superior in energy and
activity. The first step taken by the new commander was to
evacuate Philadelphia, and withdraw the army to New York.
Every difficulty was thrown in his way by Washington,
and a severe and indecisive engagement was fought during
his retreat, which is known as the Battle of Monmouth or
of Freehold Court-house. Both sides claimed the victory,
but as Clinton's movement towards New York was not
interrupted by it, it may be inferred that he had not the
worst of the encounter. Four companies of the Artillery
were engaged, and their fire was true and severe: one officer,
Lieutenant T. L. Vaughan, was killed. On the 30th June, the
English army reached Sandyhook, where they found Lord
Howe's fleet; and early in July they passed over to New
York. The conduct of the Artillery during the return from
Philadelphia to New York may be learnt from the following
order, issued by General Pattison:—"The very handsome and
obliging terms in which the General Officers and others
have repeatedly spoken of the appearance, discipline, and
good order of the Corps of Artillery, and particularly
of the conduct, care and attention of all the officers who
have been detached with the several Brigades and Battalion
guns, cannot fail to be highly pleasing and satisfactory to
the Brigadier-General. He therefore takes this occasion
to give them his best thanks, and to express further his
entire approbation of the regularity and observance of
duties that have been shown by all ranks during the late
march, and of the cheerfulness and alacrity with which
they have undergone the great fatigue of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>During this retreat from Philadelphia, the Artillerymen
were for the first time relieved of carrying their knapsacks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>and ammunition pouches, which were carried for them on
the waggons. They carried their arms, except when actually
fighting their guns, and had six cartridges in a small bag
in their pockets.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short summary of the occasions in 1778, after the
evacuation of Philadelphia, when individual Artillerymen
distinguished themselves, may be extracted from the pages
of that most conscientiously and laboriously written work,
Browne's 'England's Artillerymen;' with any requisite
additions from other sources.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July, 1778, Rhode Island was attacked by the American
General Sullivan, supported by the French fleet. The island
was garrisoned by 5000 British troops under Sir Robert
Pigott, including a company of the Royal Artillery under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel John Innes, an officer who,
as has already been mentioned, commenced his career as a
matross in 1736, and died in 1783, in command of the
Invalid Battalion. The severe labour and exposure cheerfully
undergone by the Artillery on this occasion were specially
mentioned by Sir Robert in his despatches announcing the
total defeat of the American scheme. The loss of the
Artillery amounted to thirty-three killed and wounded. In
September, 1778, General Grey sailed for Bedford, to destroy
a nest of privateers, and was accompanied by some Artillery
under Captain Scott, who blew up the American fort. In
November a body of troops, with a detachment of Artillery
under Lieutenant Ralph Wilson, sailed for Savannah in
Georgia, a place which was speedily taken. From General
Pattison's letter-books, it is easy to see that this operation
gave great satisfaction in New York: considerable stores
were taken; and the province of Georgia reduced. An officer
of the Royal Artillery bearing the same surname as he who
commanded at Rhode Island, Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Innes,
was made Governor of Savannah, and afterwards sent home
to the King with despatches. He had greatly distinguished
himself during the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the last operation of any consequence in 1778.
The Army remained concentrated at New York, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>prisoners of war who had been taken by the Americans at
Burgoyne's capitulation remained prisoners still. A few of
the officers had been exchanged for American officers; and,
in this way, General Phillips, of the Artillery, ultimately
became available for duty. General Pattison, who still
commanded the Artillery, and was with the head-quarters
of the army, received a special mark of favour from Sir
Henry Clinton in July, 1779, being appointed Commandant
of the City and Garrison of New York. It may not be
uninteresting to the reader to learn what sort of place
New York was in 1779, under a gunner's government, and
an attempt to describe it will now be made.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>At</span> the foot of Broadway, in New York (the principal street
during the American War, as it is yet, although eclipsed
in point of size by those known as Avenues,) there was, and
there is, a small patch of turf giving its name to the surrounding
houses, and known as the Bowling Green.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this Green there used to stand a statue, in lead, of His
Majesty King George III., erected by a mob, to celebrate a
victory over His Majesty's Government in a dispute in which
they believed they had the King's sympathy; and on this
Green, in July, 1776, this same statue lay prostrate, thrown
down by a similar mob, in anger because their wishes had
been thwarted. It was their boast afterwards that forty-two
thousand bullets were made out of King George's statue to
fire at King George's soldiers. But although the mob ran
riot in the city on that day, it must not be imagined that
there was no loyalty in New York. There was, among all
the respectable classes, a feeling of shame and sadness, which
showed itself in the closed churches and darkened windows,
and, later on, in the joyous welcome which the British troops
enabled them openly to give to the representatives of the
British connection. New York, for many reasons, was more
loyal than any other part of the revolted colonies, and there
were many opportunities of displaying this in the period of its
occupation by the British forces,—an occupation which, commencing
in 1776, continued uninterruptedly for over seven
years, until the war was at an end, and the colonies were lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near this Bowling Green lived, during the British occupation,
most of the military officials; and among others, in
the years 1779 and 1780, lived James Pattison, Colonel in
the Royal Artillery, Major-General in His Majesty's forces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>in America, and Commandant of the City and Garrison of
New York. And the narrative of James Pattison's life is one
which must occupy a very prominent place in a History of
the Regiment to which he belonged.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was the second son of a merchant in London, who
owned the estate at Woolwich and Plumstead, known as the
Burrage Estate. He married a daughter of the celebrated
Albert Borgard, and was repeatedly selected for appointments
requiring great tact and firmness, two qualities which
he possessed in an eminent degree. Among others, he was,
as a Lieutenant-Colonel, appointed Lieutenant-Governor of
the Royal Military Academy, and did more than any of his
predecessors, or most of those who have succeeded him, to
introduce a proper discipline among the Cadets and their
instructors, while, at the same time, he raised the tone of the
institution, and asserted, to an unheard-of extent, its independence
of the authorities of the Woolwich garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>He served with distinction in Flanders, and at the end of
the Seven Years' War he was chosen to command the companies
selected for service in Portugal. When so employed,
he won the respect of all by his dignified firmness and
courtesy, and laid the foundation of an affection towards
himself from the officers serving under him which never even
waned. On his staff in Portugal was a subaltern bearing a
name honoured then as now in the Artillery,—Adye. Lieutenant
S. P. Adye was afterwards, as a Captain-Lieutenant,
aide-de-camp to General Pattison when in command of the
Royal Artillery in New York, and was a most able and
energetic staff officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1769 Colonel Pattison was sent to Venice to superintend
the organization of the Venetian Artillery. From private
letters, which are still in existence, it would appear that he
had a very difficult task, not so much with the Artillerymen
as with the authorities, who were disposed to break faith
with him. But as he simply threatened to resign if they did
not keep their promises, he obtained what he wanted; and it
may be said of James Pattison that he never wanted more
than justice.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>General Pattison, as has already been mentioned, succeeded
Colonel Cleaveland in the command of the Fourth
Battalion of the Royal Artillery in America. He succeeded
one who was a soldier, but no statesman,—who conceived
that the utmost expected of him was to despise and defeat
any enemy who might be opposed to him. General Pattison
was equally sensible of his duty as far as military operations
were concerned; but he went beyond his predecessor in the
liberal and statesmanlike views he took of the state of
America. In his official reports, it is needless to say, he did
not enter into details beyond his province; but his private
correspondence is a mine of wealth to the student of the
great American War, and it has been placed at the disposal
of the compiler of this work by the representatives of the
family. The following letter is a dispassionate and valuable
contribution to the history of those stirring times, and
reveals at once the able character of the writer and the state
of the American Colonies. In writing to his brother from
Philadelphia, in December, 1777, he says:</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish it was in my power to give you very pleasing
accounts of the state of affairs in this distracted country;
but, indeed, it is almost a distracting consideration for
anyone who knows them, as we do by <em>experience</em>, to think
of them. Ministers have been deceived, and have never
known the true state of this country; if they had, they
never would have entered into a war with it. I own I had
very mistaken notions myself when in England of reducing
America to obedience by conquest. I have totally changed
my sentiments, not that I would wish them to be known
but to yourself, as it might not be prudent for me to
declare them; but I will confess to <em>you</em> that, by what I
have seen and heard, I am fully of opinion that all the
efforts Great Britain can make will never effectually conquer
this great continent, in which, notwithstanding all
that has been said of <em>friends</em> to Government here, and
<em>friends</em> to Government there, yet there is scarcely one
to be met with from one end of it to the other. We have
not only armies to combat with, but a whole country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>where every man, woman, and even child is your enemy,
and, in fact, do in one shape or another act as such. One
Royal Army has been already obliged to do what is not in
our History to be met with,—to lay down their arms, and
surrender prisoners of war; another Army at New York in
a state of alarm; and the Grand Army here penned up
within the narrow limits of two or three miles, and cut
off from all provisions, but what must be gained by
fighting for with large foraging parties sent out from time
to time for that purpose. In short, unless thirty thousand
men more, added to the thirty thousand we already have,
can be sent hither early in the year, the wisest thing would
be to get rid of the contest in the best manner you can,
and, if it was possible to persuade them to revoke their
Declaration of Independence, then to make one general
Act of Oblivion—give up entirely the point of taxation,
and restore the whole country to the state it was in 1763.
These are my politics, though I would not wish them to be
known. I am much afraid the prosecution of the war must
prove ruinous and destructive to Great Britain."</p>

<p class='c000'>These words have a special value, as coming from one
whose official position in command of the Artillery gave him
favourable opportunities for forming an opinion. Happily,
among British officers, opinions never interfere with the performance
of duties, however hopeless; and it will be found
that no one was more energetic than General Pattison, both
at Philadelphia and in his command at New York. At
the same time, we learn from this letter three things—the
success of the cry against England commenced in Massachusetts,
and swollen by hasty and foolish treatment on the
part of England; the falsehood of the Government statements
at home; and the great difficulties which embarrassed the
English Army in its operations, even thus early in the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in this chapter the condition of New York during
the British occupation is the subject of consideration; and
perhaps it cannot be better realized than by imagining
oneself in the company of the gallant General, as he went
his daily rounds. Hanging about in the vicinity of his house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>are orderlies, in different costume; the gunner, in full dress,
with his gold-laced cocked-hat, with <em>black</em> feather, as was
the custom then in the 4th Battalion, his hair clubbed and
powdered, white stock, white breeches, and white stockings,
and armed with a carbine and a bayonet; or, perhaps, in the
marvellous undress invented for the Battalion by Colonel
Cleaveland—a blue jacket and brown trousers. Among the
others is also to be seen an occasional negro, in no particular
uniform at all, one of a company of Virginian blacks enrolled
for duty with the Artillery and in the Ordnance Yard. In
the recent American Civil War many hard things were said
of the Northerners for declaring the slaves of the rebels to
be free, at a time when the women and children of the South
were in their homes alone and unprotected. It is but fair
to say that the example followed was our own. During the
War of Independence the same course towards the rebels was
taken by the British, and an influx of runaway slaves in New
York was the result. This, coupled with the decided immigration
of Loyalists from other districts, accounts for the
great rise in the population of New York during the British
occupation, which increased from 17,000 to 30,000. The
newspapers of the time teem with advertisements announcing
the sale of slaves, but from the fact above mentioned it is
evident that they can only apply to the slaves of Loyalists.
Some of them are so grotesque as to be worthy of reproduction:</p>

<p class='c000'>"To be sold, a strong, healthy mulatto girl, about fifteen
years of age. Has been used to household work and the
care of children. She has both had the small-pox and the
measles. For further particulars, apply to Mr. Stevens,
<em>Livery Stable Keeper</em>, Little Queen-street."</p>

<p class='c000'>"To be sold, a young negro wench, who has had the
small-pox, can cook very well, nineteen years old, and sold
for no fault. Lowest price, 70<em>l.</em>"</p>

<p class='c000'>And—"For sale, a fine negro boy and a billiard-table."</p>

<p class='c000'>Doubtless, if one looked in at the places of auction, the
poor girl "who is accustomed to the care of children" would
be found crying her heart out, while thinking of the charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>from which she has been torn, and dreading the unknown
future before her; while poor little Sambo would be seen
showing his white teeth over the table which has been the
dusky marker's little world, and from which he has found
that he is not to be separated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The newspapers of the time, in which the above advertisements
appear, are an interesting study. From them one gets
an admirable picture of the city during the British occupation—of
the business, amusements, and daily routine. One is
soon reminded that New York was under martial law. The
statute price of the loaf always headed the column, by order
of the Major-General commanding, followed by terrible
threats against the farmers on Long Island if they did not
bring their hay, without further delay, to the city for sale.
Notices to the refugees from rebel districts, informing them
where they could obtain work, were regularly inserted, for
the Commandant would have no idlers in the place. Authority
for lotteries was occasionally notified, the proceeds to go to
the aged and invalid poor; and theatrical advertisements
were frequent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Garrison Dramatic Club, whose profits went to assist
the soldiers' wives, was composed of officers of the Garrison,
who were assisted in their performances by young ladies—daughters
of New York merchants—whose parts were played,
according to the critics of the time, "with great propriety,
spirit, and accuracy." The receipts of the Club in one
year, amounted to 9,500<em>l.</em>, all of which, after deducting
unavoidable expenses, was spent in charity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rules of the theatre were somewhat arbitrary. Not
merely had the places to be secured and paid for before the
day of performance, but the takers were compelled to send
their servants at half-past four in the afternoon to keep
their seats until the curtain rose at seven. It must have
been a ludicrous sight during these two hours and a half—that
dusky audience with nothing to hear, those crowded
spectators with nothing to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the chief actors in the club was Major Williams, of
the Artillery, who was also Brigade-Major of the Garrison.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>In the Library of the Historical Society in New York there
is yet to be found frequent and favourable mention of this
officer's rendering of Macbeth and Richard III.</p>

<p class='c000'>Possibly an undue value may easily be attached to the
opinions of an audience which was, doubtless, more or less,
composed of the actors' friends; but it has been recorded
that nothing was so popular,—no wit, humour, or buffoonery
so welcome, even to the gallery,—as hits at the rebels during
the performance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The newspapers of the day were the 'Mercury,' published
on Monday; 'Robertson's Loyal American Gazette,' on
Thursday; and the 'General Advertiser,' on Friday. But
there was one more reliable, and more generally read, than
any of these,—the 'Gazette,' published every Wednesday
and Saturday, by a man called Rivington, famed for his
hospitality and as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivant</span></i>, but who proved eventually
to be a traitor. About 1781 he began to see that, under the
influence of the French Alliance and dissension in England,
the rebel cause was brightening. While, therefore, still
continuing to utter the most loyal sentiments in his journal,
he supplied the enemy, in rather an ingenious way, with all
the latest intelligence. Being a bookbinder as well as publisher,
and being wholly unsuspected, he was permitted to
send books to the Jerseys and elsewhere for sale. In the
binding of the books were concealed despatches for Washington,
who was thus supplied with the latest news from New
York and England.</p>

<p class='c000'>From advertisements in the various newspapers, the price
of tea during the British occupation would appear to have
averaged 18<em>s.</em> per lb.; corn varied with the punctuality or
otherwise of the convoys from Ireland,—a strange thing to
read of in days when America is known as the grain-producing
country of the world; and claret, from some reason or other,
was cheap and plentiful. There are, in the Royal Artillery
Record Office, permit-books of General Pattison's from which
the filial affection of the subalterns in the Garrison can be
gauged by the amount of claret they received permission to
send from New York to their anxious parents.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>But, returning to No. 1 Broadway, on the Bowling Green,
where the General lived, let the reader accompany him on
his rounds. His chestnut horse is at the door, and Captain
Adye and Captain-Lieutenant Ford, his Quartermaster, are
waiting for him. The house in which he lives was formerly
occupied by Sir Henry Clinton, now the Commander of the
Forces, and afterwards by General Robertson, the immediate
predecessor of General Pattison as Commandant of New
York. The next house, No. 3 Broadway, had been occupied
by Sir William Howe, on the first occupation of New York
by the English forces in 1776, and was destined to be the
residence of the arch-renegade, Arnold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General is a wiry, muscular man, of about fifty-four
years of age;—his staff were mere boys, and yet he outlived
them both. The characteristic which struck every one most
was his courtly urbanity: every hat which was raised by
passers-by was courteously acknowledged; and for every one
whom he knew there was a pleasant, kindly word. He looks
even brighter and more cheery this morning than usual, and,
judging from the barely-suppressed merriment of his staff—when
he is not looking—there is evidently some cause for
cheerfulness. The joke is this. If James Pattison excels in
one thing more than another, it is in correspondence. Last
night had found him in a good vein, and his staff are still
chuckling over some letters which they had copied this
morning. Let three be selected, with a judicious blending
of love and war, and let preference be given to the first.
The General was, in the strongest and most benevolent sense,
a father to his officers; there was no one in whose affairs he
was not ready to take an interest; and his sympathy with
all under his command is visible in every line of his correspondence.
As the student sits among his letter-books, in
the Dryasdust Record Offices looking out on the muddy
Thames, there are times when, out of the yellow pages and
faded writing, there seems to shape itself a figure, which,
even at this distance of time, has such a loveable reality
about it, that he seems to have known it as a dear friend.
In return for the interest the General felt in and showed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>his officers, he asked but one thing—their confidence; and
the extent of his private correspondence shows that he did
not ask in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there had been an exception,—unconscious, perhaps,
but not unnoticed. A giddy subaltern had fallen in love.
The General hardly expected to be told of this. In those
days, as now, it might be predicated of subalterns that "'tis
their nature to!" But this youth resolved to marry, and
did not tell his resolution. He was away in Florida; there
were no regular posts; perhaps the General might not
approve of it; and, besides, those sweet hours of bliss were
too dear to be interrupted by extraneous correspondence.
So he was married. At first all was happiness. Love was
still in every room of the cottage; and the General, like
everything else, was forgotten. But there came a day when,
in that little cottage, there were "Rooms to let," for Love
had taken umbrage at a threadbare ruffian, called Poverty,
who had taken up his abode. So, like the Prodigal Son in
the Parable, the mournful subaltern remembered his General,
and, writing a doleful letter as to the expenses of the married
state, suggested a happy arrangement by which his income
might be improved. To which the General had overnight
penned the following reply. The reader will bear in mind
that the General, like St. Peter, was himself also a married
man.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>"The letter you favoured me with gives me, at last,
an opportunity of congratulating you upon your marriage.
I am very sensible it is a state which must be attended by
extraordinary expenses, and wish it was in my power to
enable you, with perfect ease, to defray them. I would
even adopt the mode you propose, of appointing you
Quartermaster, if I thought the good of the service
required; but as it does not appear to me necessary for
every detached company to have a staff annexed to it, I
am sure you will have the goodness to excuse my incurring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>any extraordinary charges upon Government which I could
not properly justify.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I am, with regard, &amp;c., &amp;c."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another letter which the General had written was to a
friend at Woolwich, who superintended the recruiting for the
Battalion, which was then much below its establishment.
In answer to repeated remonstrances, a few handfuls of men
from the other Battalions were sent,—not the best, it is to
be feared, if human nature then were like human nature
now; and, at last, recruits being no longer obtainable in
England, the experiment was tried of recruiting in Ireland,
and the first draft was sent to the 4th Battalion. At this
time the Irish Artillery, afterwards the 7th Battalion
of the Royal Artillery, enjoyed a separate existence, and
secured the best recruits in Ireland. The refuse only
remained for the Royal Artillery, and the following is the
graphic language used by the gallant General in describing
the new levies as they landed in New York.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The drafts have arrived, four having deserted, and one
died upon the passage. I should not have been very much
afflicted if many of those who landed here had saved me,
either by death or desertion, the pain of looking at them,
for such warriors of 5 feet 5½ inches I never saw raised
before for the service of Artillery.... I presume
the reason why so few stand of arms accompanied them
was the consideration of these whippers-in and postilions
of fellows being unable to bear them: but I must try how
far the strength of these diminutive warriors is equal to
carry <em>muskets cut down</em>, for they shall never appear, while I
command them, otherwise than as soldiers....
Hard times, indeed, and great must be the scarcity of men,
when the Royal Artillery is obliged to take such reptiles.
I would they were back in the bogs from which they
sprang."</p>

<p class='c000'>In less than a hundred years, had the General lived, he
would have seen many of even a worse stamp landing here,
to swell the army of New York Rowdies,—men who poison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>the blood of the American commonwealth, making the great
Republic break out into hideous and pestilent sores, which
in the eyes of the world deface and hide the beauties it so
undoubtedly possesses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third and last letter to be quoted is a more serious
one; and is addressed to the Right Honourable the Board of
Ordnance, at this time very wooden-headed, very obstinate,
very devoted to every form of circumlocution. Their officials
loved then to snub, and carp, and disallow; to thrust on the
festive board at any joyous time some hideous skull of pigheaded
queries; and to look with suspicion on any one who
dared to think for himself. The officials of the Ordnance
have passed away; but who shall say that the type is
extinct?</p>

<p class='c000'>Ah! this gunner who governed New York! He had his
rough hours with the rebels, and with the citizens, and with
his motley army, but the roughest were when the convoys
coming in brought the usual budget of stupendous idiocy,
written by clerks who knew not, probably, whether America
lay to the east or the west of the Tower, but who felt that
their duty was to be to the conscientious officer an eternal
nightmare.</p>

<p class='c000'>The good General, who thought of England's interests
before anything else, had recently given permission for the
pay of the men to be drawn by bills on Messrs. Cox and Mair,
the rate of exchange at the time being such as to leave
a handsome surplus to the Government on the sale of the
bills. But no sooner did the members of the worshipful Board
hear of this, than each particular hair stood on end on each
individual head, and a letter was despatched to the General
reprimanding him for daring to think of himself. Fortunately
Messrs. Cox and Mair protected the bills: but no more
were drawn, and the General's scheme for saving his
country's money was ruthlessly butchered. As luck would
have it, the same mail brought to the General letters of
commendation from the King and all in authority; and the
confirmation of the rank of Major-General, bestowed on him
by Sir Henry Clinton for service in the field. This enabled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>him to quote the satisfaction expressed by others with his
conduct, in the commencement of his letter to the Board,
thus giving a point to his next dignified sentences, acknowledging
their rebuke. "These marks, my Lord and
gentlemen, of your displeasure, and the never having
received the honour (notwithstanding my unwearied endeavours
to deserve it,) of <em>your</em> declared approbation in
any instance since I have been entrusted with the direction
of your affairs in this service, cannot fail to give me the
most sensible mortification. The extensive and complicated
command I have is sufficiently onerous of itself, but under
the present circumstances the weight becomes less supportable.
I should, therefore, be exceedingly glad if I might
be permitted to transfer it over to abler hands, who might
probably be more fortunate in giving fuller satisfaction."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is unnecessary to say that the brainless scribes in the
Tower were a little quieter after this, and more sparing of
their senseless criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before doing anything else, the General's custom during
his morning's ride was to look at the batteries near his
house, known then as Fort George and Grand Battery. The
former was a regular fortification, and the latter mounted
94 guns. They were situated where the Castle Garden—for
the reception of emigrants—and the South Ferry House now
stand. They commanded the river between New York and
Brooklyn heights, and New York and Staten Island. The fortifications
on Brooklyn heights, especially Fort Stirling, had
been immensely strengthened by General Pattison, and not a
point on New York Island was left unarmed by him. He
availed himself of many breast-works and trenches, and of
large works like Fort Independence, which the Americans
had built when they contemplated the defence, instead of the
evacuation of New York: and he strengthened them in the
most laborious and efficient manner. To his efforts more
than any other's, was the fact due that the City remained
unmolested during the whole war. His labours and duties
were enormous. His command being co-extensive with the
North American continent, he would one day receive demands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>for powder and guns from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the next
day from Florida, or from Captain Traille in Virginia.
Captain Traille was one of those men to be met with even
now in the Artillery, a man with a grievance. He had been
made <em>local</em> Major, and had applied without success to have
the rank made substantive. He took his revenge out of the
Government by demanding stores in the wildest manner.
The first thing he always did on arriving at a new station
was to send in requisitions, as if he were going to fortify
Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soreness on Captain Traille's part appears in other
ways in the records of the time. A young gentleman, named
Black, who, according to the custom in those days, had carried
arms in his company with great distinction, refused a commission
in the Artillery offered him by the Master-General, and
accepted one instead in Lord Rawdon's New York Volunteers.
It is easy to imagine the lad going to his Captain for advice,
and finding him brooding over the unfortunate Majority, or
calculating how next to worry the authorities with store-demands.
And having imagined this, it is not difficult to
imagine what the Captain's advice would be.</p>

<p class='c000'>While talking of stores, it is worthy of mention that at
one time so heavy had been the demands on the General from
out-stations, particularly from Halifax, which was reduced to
barely seven rounds a gun, that there were only 476 barrels
of powder left in the whole city and district of New York,
under British rule. There was, as is apparent from contemporary
correspondence, not a little anxiety on the subject in
the Commandant's office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although General Pattison was saved much laborious and
unpleasant correspondence by having a very competent staff,
he occasionally took the pen himself in official differences,
even with his regimental subordinates. One, Captain William
Johnstone, had entered a remonstrance showing that two of
the officers posted to his company were prisoners in the hands
of the rebels, and the other two were in England. Had he
remained content with a bare statement of facts, he would
have done well, but he went on to make insinuations; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>after also disparaging the men who had been sent to his
Company with the last draft, he concluded by hinting that
the climate of Pensacola, where he was stationed, disagreed
with him. To whom the General: "As to the idea which you
think proper to throw out, and which I cannot but think
an extraordinary one, of officers endeavouring to get out of
their commands, no such applications have ever been made
to me; consequently, I cannot have granted the improper
indulgences you allude to; but with respect to indulgences
to officers under my command, I must desire to be considered
the best judge how far they may be bestowed,
consistent with the good of the service....
The men whom you think so bad were not picked out, but
impartially drafted; and if any of them carry the marks
of bad behaviour on their backs, I hope the end will be
answered by their correcting it for the future, and that
their good conduct under you will be the means of soon
wearing them out.... I am very sorry
that the climate of Pensacola disagrees with you so much,
but hope that you will soon recover your health."</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will now be good enough to accompany the
General up Broadway, towards Hester Street, in the Bowery,
then one of the extreme streets yet built in New York, and
near the spot where the British landed on 16th September,
1776, to occupy the city. It was close to the place where St.
Mark's Church now stands; and at that date was marked
by the existence of the house of the last Dutch Governor of
New York, built of yellow brick, imported from Holland,
now unfortunately destroyed. In Hester Street lived Mrs.
Douglas, the young wife of as brave a subaltern of Artillery
as ever stepped. The General had just received a despatch
from Sir Henry Clinton, then engaged in operations up the
Hudson, in which young Douglas's bravery, coolness, and
skill had been mentioned in the highest terms. Before
writing to his subaltern to express the satisfaction he derived
from such a report, the General hastened to tell the good
news to Mrs. Douglas; thus killing two birds with one stone,
for it enabled him to add to his letter a postscript which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>knew young Douglas would value, giving all the latest news
from his home. It was this thoughtfulness which endeared
him to his officers; it is from such little data as this that the
student learns how loveable as well as able this gallant
officer was. The day shall come—and not so far distant—when
the General shall stop in the same street at a door not
much farther on, but his face shall be sad, and his step slow,
as he mounts the staircase to tell of a young husband lying
under the turf near Charlestown, wounded to death in the
battle, and dying with his wife's name on his lips, and love
for her in his glazing eye. As he enters the room, there
shall be that in his face which a woman's wit shall too
quickly read, and the cry of a broken heart shall echo on the
old man's ears for years to come!</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Hester Street the General rode towards Ranelagh
House, then a species of Tea Gardens, out of the city, but
only a little east of the present intersection of Anthony
Street and West Broadway. About twenty-five years before
the British occupation of New York, to which this chapter
refers, this house was the residence of Major James, of the
Royal Artillery, a man of great taste and considerable private
means. He went on one occasion on leave to England; and,
during his absence, the celebrated Riot on the arrival of the
Stamps took place. A mob, which took the name of the
"Sons of Liberty," having first burnt the Lieutenant-Governor
in effigy, and broken his Coach of State to pieces,
went off playfully to Major James's unprotected house,
burned his valuable library and large collection of works of
art, and ruined his beautiful garden. A few months later, it
became a public-house, kept by one John Jones, who sent
fireworks off in the evening, and by day and night gratified
the thirst of the Sons of Liberty. It was a curious heaping
of coals of fire, that a few years later it should fall to this
very Major James—after a six weeks' passage from Plymouth,
to bring the joyful news of the repeal of the Stamp Act.
Ranelagh House had become during the War a great place
for recruiting for the various Regiments raised for the King's
service in New York. During General Pattison's command,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>no less than 4000 Loyalist Volunteers were doing duty in the
city, and 3000 more were away on duty in the South. Some
statistics regarding these volunteer corps may be interesting.
The New Jersey Gentlemen Volunteers, embodied—as the
recruiting notices said—"during this wanton rebellion,"
received each 20 dollars bounty, and "everything necessary
to complete a gentleman soldier;" Lord Rawdon's Ireland
Volunteers received each 30<em>s.</em> bounty; and men were tempted
to enlist into Colonel Simcoe's Queen's Ranger Hussars by
the promise of "an elegant horse, cloathing &amp;c., to the
amount of 40 guineas: the bringer to get 2<em>l.</em> 2<em>s.</em>" Men
enlisting into the regular army got one guinea bounty; and
on one occasion when men were wanted for regiments in
the West Indies, the married men of New York were tempted
by the offer of 5<em>s.</em> a week for the husband, 3<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em> a week for
his wife, and 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> a week for each child, over and above
prize-money.</p>

<p class='c000'>Side by side with these various notices, as well as on every
public place and in every newspaper, an intimation was to
be found, characteristic of the General's method and accuracy,
calling upon any one who had any claim against the Royal
Artillery, or the Ordnance, to submit it without delay.
This same method is visible in all his internal civil arrangements,
showing that he possessed admirable qualifications for
the post of Home Secretary as well as General. He ordered
every stranger on arrival in the city to report himself on
pain of suspicion; the citizens had to form a nightly watch
in their respective wards, subject to 24 hours' imprisonment,
or 1 dollar fine, if absent, in addition to making up the duty;
each chimney had to be swept once a month under penalty
of a 5<em>l.</em> fine; a certain number, only, of public-houses was
licensed, on the recommendation of the principal officers of
the Army and Navy, or of respectable inhabitants; and any
one selling liquor without a licence was fined 5<em>l.</em> and the
money given to the poor. All carmen were obliged to have
licences; and if any one overcharged his fare, he was fined
40<em>s.</em>, one half going to the poor, and the other half to the
informer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>A favourite punishment for misdemeanours and theft was
banishment beyond the lines, accompanied by further severe
punishment if the offender should return. The inhabitants
were liable to confinement in the main-guard, but their cases
had to be inquired into by the civil magistrates before 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
on the following day. Negro slaves and others deemed
worthy of corporal punishment were sent to a court-martial;
and able-bodied offenders were not unfrequently sent on
board the Admiral's Fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General's arrangements for the various ferries were
excellent, and all the profits went to the poor. Boatmen had
to take out licences, and in event of overcharge they were
punished in the same way as the carmen. Auctioneers had
not merely to provide themselves with licences, but also to
find sureties to the amount of 5000<em>l.</em> New York currency.
And at any meeting of the vestry which concerned the
disbursement of public money, the Mayor was compelled to
be present, and make a report to the Commandant, as well
as to see that his wishes were complied with.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good deal of trouble arose from what was called the
Neutral Ground, extending some 30 miles above the Island
of New York, and not included in the lines of either army.
It was a fertile and populous country, but much infested by
bands of plunderers, called cow-boys and skinners. The cow-boys
lived within the British lines, and bought, or stole,
cattle for the use of the troops. The rendezvous of the
skinners was within the American lines. They professed to
be great patriots, making it their ostensible business to
plunder those who refused to take the oath of allegiance to
the State of New York. But they were ready in fact to
plunder any one, and the cattle they thus obtained were often
sold to the cow-boys in exchange for dry goods from New
York. It was when traversing this neutral ground, that the
unfortunate Major André was captured. By the way, the
General in his morning's ride passed the house where André
was to dine the evening before he should start on his ill-fated
journey. It was an old Dutch house which remained
standing until 1850, near the present intersection of 2nd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Avenue and 34th Street; and was occupied during the British
occupation, as an officer's quarter, by Colonel Williams of the
80th Regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In continuing his ride, the General went to Greenwich,
a village situated at that time a mile and a half out of the
city, but now in the very heart of it, where the German
troops in English pay were stationed. Of all the mistakes
made by England in that war—and they were many—the
hiring of mercenaries to fight the Americans was perhaps
the greatest. It irritated many loyal men into rebellion, and
gave a union and cohesion to the disloyal, such as they never
otherwise would have gained. Nor were the mercenaries
very valuable as soldiers; they were discontented and
quarrelsome; and to their want of vigilance was the irreparable
disaster of Trenton wholly due. Even to this day,
the Americans talk most bitterly of their being hired by the
English to shoot down their own flesh and blood; and there
can be no doubt that more soreness was due to this circumstance,
than to any other connected with the war. Apart,
however, from the general question, there was no Commanding
officer whose management of the foreign troops
displayed so much tact, as General Pattison. Whether it
were on duty, or on such occasions as the celebrated ball
given by him on the King's Birthday in 1780, which he
opened with the wife of the German Baron who commanded
at Greenwich, his courtesy and tact were always exerted to
cement differences, or allay grievances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning homewards from Greenwich, the General rode
through a great many burnt streets, burnt by incendiaries the
night after the English occupied New York, and at a fire which
took place later;—past not a few churches which had been
converted into prisons, riding-schools, and hospitals, for at
times the sickness in the city was very great;—past
Vauxhall, where Sir Peter Warren lived; past the house in
Hanover Square where Prince William stayed, when sent out
by the King in compliment to his American subjects; and
past the dwelling of that most princely of dinner-givers,
honest Admiral Walton. As he rode along, he passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>printed anathemas on the walls against privateering, and
notices of 20 guineas reward from the Government, and 10
guineas additional from the insurance offices, for the discovery
of any man who should have seduced a soldier on board a
privateer. There were no less than 5000 New Yorkers
engaged during the war in this lawless occupation. It was
certainly adding insult to injury, after the sleepless nights
they sometimes caused to the General, but the owners of a
very fast privateer had actually the impertinence to name
their ship after him.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his way home he rode into the Ordnance Yard, where a
few words of comfort had to be spoken to the men whose
wages were so disproportionate to those of ordinary civil
labourers, that not merely were they discontented, but they
could hardly live at all. Ordinary labourers in the city got
5<em>s.</em> a day, and skilled artisans could earn as much as 12<em>s.</em>
and 15<em>s.</em>; but in the Ordnance Yard the average wage was
only 3<em>s.</em> a day and a ration, and in vain had the General urged
on the Board of Ordnance to sanction some approximation to
the wages of the other labourers in New York. While men
could be got with ease near the Tower of London for 3<em>s.</em> a
day, the Board of Ordnance might as well have been expected
to pay more in America, as their clerks to learn geography.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General having now returned to Broadway, let two
or three instances be mentioned, in which he prominently
figured during his command at New York, before closing this
chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first shall be the only instance in which the General
ever showed any symptom of insubordination. He forgot the
soldier in the gunner. On the last day of May, 1779, he
accompanied Sir Henry Clinton, the Commander-in-Chief, to
within 3 miles of Stony Point on the Hudson; and as Artillery
became necessary in carrying out the proposed attack,
General Pattison was ordered to take command of the troops.
During the night—a dark, moonless night—the Artillery for
the service was got up, and the batteries completed by five
o'clock in the morning, notwithstanding great difficulties,
arising from a bad landing-place and a very steep precipice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Orders were then given to commence firing on the enemy's
works, and, notwithstanding the great distance, the fire was
soon seen to have been effectual. Sir Henry Clinton therefore
sent instructions to the General to cease firing, but the
General's blood was up. The range had been got to an inch
and he hungered to go on; so instead of ceasing fire, he sent
back an earnest request to be allowed a few more rounds.
Very soon, however, a white flag was seen; and in a few
minutes it was known that the whole rebel force had
surrendered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next sketch may be said to show the culminating
point of the General's career as Commandant of New York.
The winter of 1779 was the hardest, it is believed, ever
recorded in that city. The water was frozen between New
York and Staten Island, and guns were carried over on
sleighs. It was an anxious time. The insular advantages of
New York disappeared before this unexpected high-road
of ice; the Jerseys were swarming with Washington's
troops; and as nearly the whole of the regular forces had
gone from New York to Charlestown on special service, the
General dreaded an attack which he might be unable to
resist. Notwithstanding the croaking of many advisers, he
called out, and resolved to arm, the inhabitants, to test the
sincerity of their professions of loyalty, and to ascertain
whether his rule in the city had been a successful one. To
those who assured him that it was a rash measure, he
answered that he felt confident that the number of doubtful
characters was but trifling, and as those few would be
blended in the ranks with the many who could be relied on,
they would be less capable of doing mischief under arms,
than if "left to lurk in their dwellings."</p>

<p class='c000'>And the event proved that he was right. In a few hours
he had 4300 loyal volunteers between 17 and 60 years of age,
armed at their own expense, until arms could no longer be
bought, when they received them from the King's stores; he
had merchants of the city standing sentry on his own house;
and so fired were the naval officers by his energy, that they
landed all the sailors they could spare, and put them under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>his orders. In return, the General courteously named a new
battery which he was building, the Royal Naval Battery, and
gave it to the sailors to man. And the result was that the
city remained unmolested.</p>

<p class='c000'>The anxiety the General suffered during the winter of
1779 aggravated a complaint from which he had been suffering
for some time, which he describes in his diary as "a stubborn
disease which no medicine can allay," and he began to feel
that rest and change were necessary. So he applied for, and
obtained, leave of absence to go home for the benefit of the
Bath waters; but so reluctant was he to leave his post that
it was late in the autumn of 1780, before he actually sailed.
During the few months immediately preceding his departure
his correspondence is a mixture of explanations to the
authorities at home of the reasons for his return, and
entreaties to his officers to write to him at Bath, and keep
him posted in all the news of the war. During the three years
of his command he had got everything into such admirable
order, that its transfer to his successor was simpler than
could have been expected from its complicated and extensive
nature. He received a perfect ovation on his departure, both
from the civil and military part of the population; and the
dear old man had hardly sat down in Bath, before he wrote
off to all his old friends of the 4th Battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all that General Pattison did—whether on duty or not—he
was essentially conscientious and hard-working. And
these are the two qualities which rule the world. George
Macdonald—in his lecture on Milton—said that on rising from
a study of the poet's works, he felt that he had been gazing on
one who was, in every noble sense of the word, <em>a man</em>. And
the student of General Pattison's letters and orders feels also,
in quitting the dusty tomes and faded letters, that he has
been conversing with a true, a noble man.</p>

<p class='c000'>A brief notice of his death will suitably close this chapter.
He lived to be a very old man. Twice he was appointed
Commandant of Woolwich, a command less onerous than
that which he held in America, but still a prize to which
every Artillery officer looks forward. At last on a March
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>morning in the year 1805, that stubborn disease which indeed
no medicine can allay, that old, old disease, death, stole into
Hill Street, Berkeley Square, and touched on the shoulder,
in his 82nd year, the gallant old soldier, a chapter in whose
life has just been alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a year of note for England. War was going on in
the East and in the West, and success had attended the
English arms in both. Europe was bristling with armed
men, whom the genius and the dread of Napoleon had produced;
and in England alone, besides a gigantic regular
army, 325,000 volunteers had rallied to protect the soil
against a not improbable invasion. The cost of the army
that year was over fourteen millions, in addition to which over
four millions were voted for the Ordnance; and no less than
four and a half millions more for the support of the militia
and volunteers fell upon the groaning taxpayers. Nearly
everything in England was taxed, and this year saw the
taxes increased. A man's pension, office, personal estate, and
everything that could be called a luxury was heavily mulct;
if a legacy were left him, it shrank wofully in the process of
reaching him; his profession or trade was made but another
excuse for picking his pocket; if he smoked, the tax-gatherer
waited round the corner; if he took snuff, the same relentless
visitor called upon him; and yet, after all, the revenue of
the country fell far short of its expenditure. The horrified
fund-holder saw Consols quoted at 58, and yet Parliament
borrowing right and left to make the two ends meet. Twenty-four
millions were borrowed by annuities, and twelve millions
by Exchequer bills; and driven to his wits' end by want of
funds, the Chancellor of the Exchequer started lotteries to
raise the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>A year of note in England. It was the year when
Trafalgar was fought, and a country wept in the hour of
victory for a life that could not be spared. A year when
men were Titans; a fit year for a soldier to live; no unfit
one in which he could die who had done to the very last his
duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March, 1805, the old General passed to his rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Perhaps, as he lay dying, his mind wandered to the Far
West, where so important a part of his career had been
passed; to the Hudson, bound then in the grip of winter;
to the trees at West Point waving their naked arms in the
wind, as if praying for summer; to New York spreading in
peace as it never could have spread in war; to that great
country, destined to be greater yet, but ah! never to be so
pure as in those days of its infancy as a Republic, whose
people were listening—even as he died—to the words addressed
to them by their new President, words of soberness
and peace, such as Washington himself would have loved.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the old man went to sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <span class='sc'>Conclusion of the War.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Before</span> summing up the Artillery share in the American
War of Independence, a glance may be taken at the
domestic life of the Regiment at this time. From the date
when the Regimental feeling first developed itself, there has
always been a body of officers whom taste, opportunity, or
ability has singled out to express the hopes, schemes, or
resolutions, which may have existed among the officers at
large for the welfare of the Corps. The centre of the
Regimental life which has found its expression in such men
has always been Woolwich. In the earlier days of the
Regiment this was natural, as its head-quarters and its commanding
officer were at that station: in later times, when
the Regiment became too large for the supervision of one
man, the head-quarters of the Battalions were concentrated
there; and after the appointment of a Deputy-Adjutant-General
of the Royal Artillery, his office remained at
Woolwich for many years, the centre of administration of
the whole corps. The large force of Artillery always at
Woolwich, the manufacturing departments, and the numerous
Regimental establishments, such, for example, as the Royal
Artillery Institution, and the Department of Artillery studies,
conspire at the present day to render Woolwich more than
ever the centre of the Regiment's intellectual and domestic life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the correspondence between officers at out-stations and
at head-quarters, at various times in the Regiment's history,
may be read much that is interesting of Regimental schemes
and wishes. The great domestic event during the American
war was undoubtedly the formation of the Invalid Battalion,
thus ridding the four service Battalions of their invalid
companies, and giving them effective men instead. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>promotion given by the augmentation gave also great satisfaction
to the officers, and in no place was it hailed with more
delight than in America. Although the Invalid Battalion
was not formed until 1779, its formation had been part of a
scheme which had entered into the consideration of the
thoughtful officers of the Regiment for some years. In a
letter from General Pattison, at New York, to Captain Blomefield,
at Woolwich, the scheme is thus alluded to. "I have
just time, and that is all, to acknowledge and thank you
for your obliging communication of the new arrangement
for the Corps of Artillery. I began to despair of that plan,
after lying dormant so long, ever taking place. You will,
I am sure, do me the justice to believe that its being
brought to light again, and carried into execution, affords
me the truest satisfaction, and I very sincerely congratulate
you upon the event. I hope, too, it is a prelude to something
still better, <em>and that the next step will be to form the
four Battalions into as many Regiments, to consist of two
Battalions each</em>; and then I think the young officers need
not be very solicitous to get into the Line." This is a very
interesting quotation; and shows that the idea which has
frequently been entertained, although happily never carried
out, of dividing the Regiment into small Regiments with
independent promotion, is at least a century old. Division
of a different description may soon be necessary; a more
thorough separation of the Garrison Artillery from the Horse
and Field Artillery; but a division into several Regiments
would have few good results, and many evil. That the
division, which it is said above may become necessary, has
never been effected, is demonstrative of the strength of the
Regimental feeling, which could tolerate so many anomalies,
rather than admit the small end of the wedge of separation.
As science progresses, Siege and Garrison Artillery wander
farther away every day from the Field branch of the Arm;
and the difficulty of ensuring the necessary proficiency in
officers who are changed repeatedly from one service to
another wholly distinct, as well as the natural tendencies of
young officers towards the mounted branches, may some day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>compel the issue of the long deferred edict of divorce. That
such divorce is practicable without infringing on the Regimental
system is as firmly believed by those who have given
the subject their consideration, as that the duties of the
various branches would be better performed, were the officers
to realize that they would be retained in their performance
during the whole of their professional lives. Embarrassing
details, and individual hardships, might terrify a military
reformer from undertaking the task; but such hardships are
inevitable in every reform, and it is the duty of a conscientious
and statesmanlike reformer to master details, instead
of being mastered by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>A century ago, the anxiety for a division of the Regiment
which animated not a few thoughtful officers was inspired by
the longing to create a promotion in the junior ranks, which
would stimulate zeal, and remove the despair which was
creeping over them. Not a few subalterns during the American
War, who distinguished themselves, asked and obtained
as their reward commissions in the Line. The elder officers
might well become anxious, and look hungrily for any scheme
which would deter their younger comrades from abandoning
a service to which they did honour. And in this anxiety we
may read an explanation of the almost undue delight which
the creation of the Invalid Battalion, and eight additional
service companies, with the consequent promotion, produced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not that in the Fourth Battalion there was not another
minor reason for rejoicing. Its head-quarter staff had accompanied
the Battalion almost from the commencement of the
War; and there was no one at home to give the same attention
to the recruiting, as would have been paid by the Battalion's
own staff. The creation of two new service companies, to
remain at Woolwich as a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Depôt</span> for the companies abroad,
would, it was hoped, ensure more care in recruiting, and, as
General Pattison wrote ironically, "my friends will not be
put to the trouble of sending me any more drafts of <em>picked</em>
men." The recruiting accounts for the various companies
would also be expedited, for under the existing arrangement
it too often happened, as the General wrote, that "the Agents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>have been prevented by more important affairs from bringing
to any settlement the concerns of those, who are at 3000
miles' distance."</p>

<p class='c000'>But there were more pleasing subjects of correspondence
between Woolwich and the out-stations than recruiting or
promotion. There was a genuine desire springing up in the
hearts of the more thoughtful officers for a more scientific
training, a desire which was daily acquiring strength, and
whose mere existence ensured success; for those who sought
it for others, endeavoured by their own exertions to secure it
for themselves. At this time in the Regiment's history the
feeling attained strength and certainty that to be a scientific
corps was as high an aim as to win battles. Armed science
was felt to be the aim of study. Something higher than
mere gallantry, something more durable than brilliancy or
<em>dash</em>, was felt to be necessary in officers of Artillery.
Inventive genius was encouraged in the professional field;
individual talent was coaxed and rewarded; and to the
ordinary Regimental <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>, without which a military life
would be a mere Valley of Dry Bones, was added scientific
enthusiasm. There was, doubtless, much haziness as to
ways and means; much uncertainty as to the details of the
closer alliance which it was felt should exist between the
corps and the scientific world; but there was enthusiasm,
and a readiness to employ any aids already existing, which
would certainly ensure success. The foundation of the Royal
Military Repository; the establishment of such Government
works as those at Waltham Abbey; the closer connection
between the Royal Laboratory and the Regiment by the
appointment of Captain Congreve as the Controller of the
former,—all combined to give increased life and strength to
the scientific tendencies which might otherwise have languished.
The feeling which was to find strong and eloquent
expression from distinguished, although unprofessional lips,
nearly a century later, in the same Woolwich where it had
been born, was certainly, albeit dimly, in existence then.
With what a ring did the words now to be quoted echo in
the old birthplace of the Regiment! How grandly did they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>give shape and consistency to the dreams which for a hundred
years had been haunting those to whom their profession
was dear!</p>

<p class='c000'>"The two classes," said the eloquent speaker,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> "which
will have an increasing—it may be a preponderating—influence
on the fate of the human race for some time, will
be the pupils of Aristotle and those of Alexander,—the men
of science and the soldiers. In spite of all appearances
and all declamations to the contrary, that is my firm conviction.
They, and they alone, will be left to rule, because
they alone—each in his own sphere—have learnt to obey.
It is, therefore, most needful for the welfare of society that
they should pull with, and not against, each other,—that
they should understand each other, respect each other, take
counsel with each other, supplement each other's defects,
bring out each other's higher tendencies, counteract each
other's lower ones. The scientific man has something to
learn of you, which I doubt not that he will learn in good
time. You, again, have something to learn of him, which
you, I doubt not, will learn in good time likewise. Repeat—each
of you according to his powers—the old friendship
between Aristotle and Alexander; and so, from the sympathy
and co-operation of you two, a class of thinkers and
actors may yet arise, which can save this nation, and the
other civilized nations of the world, from that of which I
had rather not speak, and wish that I did not think, too
often and too earnestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I may be a dreamer; and I may consider, in my turn,
as wilder dreamers than myself, certain persons who fancy
that their only business in life is to make money;—the
scientific man's only business to show them how to make
money;—and the soldier's only business to guard their
money for them. Be that as it may, the finest type of
civilized man which we are likely to see for some generations
to come will be produced by a combination of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>truly military with the truly scientific man. I say, I may
be a dreamer; but you at least, as well as my scientific
friends, will bear with me, for my dream is to your
honour."</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return to the operations of the Army in America.
In the last chapter allusion was made to the successful attack
made on Stony Point, on the Hudson, by the British troops
from New York, in which General Pattison took a prominent
part. Very shortly afterwards a dashing attempt was made
by the Americans to retake it. The post was considered to
be safe against any sudden surprise; but at midnight, on
the 15th July, 1779, a bold and daring attempt was made to
retake it, and it was carried by storm in less than twenty
minutes. The number of the assailants was stated by themselves
not to exceed six hundred, under Brigadier Wayne.
The garrison was nearly equal in strength, and commanded
by Colonel Johnson, of the 17th Regiment, an officer of
considerable experience and reputation; yet the enemy,
advancing in two or three columns from different points, was
in a few minutes master of the place. The Commandant of
New York, in his report of the occurrence to Lord Townshend,
said: "It must, in justice, be allowed to General
Wayne's credit, as well as to all acting under his orders,
that no instance of inhumanity was shown to any of the
unhappy captives. No one was unnecessarily put to the
sword or wantonly wounded. Our loss in killed is not yet
ascertained, but it is thought to be trifling, and the
number of wounded amounts only to one Captain, four
subalterns, and about eight-and-thirty men, of whom is
one corporal of the Artillery. The rebels assert that they
had only four men killed. Our loss in prisoners is a very
serious one—almost the whole of the 17th Regiment, two
companies of the 71st (Grenadiers), about sixty of the
Loyal American Corps, and, I am particularly grieved to
say, one Captain, one subaltern, four non-commissioned
officers, thirty-nine privates, and one drummer of the
Artillery. One subaltern (Lieutenant Roberts) made his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>escape by getting to the shore, and swimming near a mile
to the 'Vulture' Sloop of War."<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as they obtained possession of the work, the
Americans turned the guns of the fort against the opposite
post of Verplank's Point, occupied by the 33rd Regiment,
Ferguson's Corps, and part of the Loyal American Battalion.
Part of the rebel force, under General Macdougal, threatened
an attack upon the east side, and repeatedly attempted to
force the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquets</span>, but without success, for Colonel Webster
and the troops under his command behaved with great spirit.
Reinforcements from the camp and from Philipsburg soon
arrived; and the enemy, somewhat hastily, evacuated Stony
Point, demolishing the works as much as possible, and
carrying off all the brass guns and stores in a large armed
galley, mounting one 32-pounder and eight 4-pounders, which
they sent down the river for the purpose. Fortunately, the
wind was against the vessel on her return; and Lieutenant
Douglas, of the Artillery, who was in command of a detachment
at Verplank's Point, opened fire on her with such
success from an 18-pounder gun, that, after being hulled
several times, she was run on shore to prevent her sinking,
and then set on fire. Lieutenant Douglas, as was mentioned
in the last chapter, and his detachment, were honoured by
the thanks of the Commander-in-Chief for their good
behaviour. "Endeavours were afterwards used to recover
the cannon, but as they did not succeed it was presumed
that the rebels with their usual industry found some
means, under favour of the night, to convey them up the
river. Upon the enemy evacuating Stony Point, we once
more took possession of it, with the 42nd, 63rd, and 64th
Regiments. Captain Ferguson is made Governor, and it
is now fortifying with a close work, which it had not
before. The Army is since fallen back again from Dobbs's
Ferry to its former camp at Philipsburg."<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The next event worthy of mention is that described by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the Commandant of New York as "a most extraordinary
attempt to take by assault the post of Paulis Hook, that
has been occupied by the King's troops ever since they
took possession of New York." This story has been told
by American writers, but it will be equally interesting to
English and American readers to have placed before them
the official report of the occurrence, made by General
Pattison to Lord Townshend. "Paulis Hook," wrote the
gallant General, "is on the Jersey shore, opposite to this
town, and considered as an appendage to it. I am sorry
to say the enterprise, bold as it was, succeeded but too
well, and little to the honour of the defendants. That
your Lordship may judge of the strength of this post
from its natural situation and from the works raised for
its protection, I send the enclosed plan, which will show
how far it ought to have been out of the reach of insult.
The troops allotted to garrison it were the 4th Battalion
of Skinner's Provincial Brigade, under the command of
Colonel Buskirk, and a part of the Invalid Battalion.
Major Sutherland, of the Invalid Battalion, was the Commandant.
On the preceding day it was determined that
Colonel Buskirk should march out a detachment that
evening, with the design of surprising a party of 100
rebels near the English neighbourhood. As the garrison
would thereby be much weakened, the Major applied to
me for a reinforcement for that night of a Captain and
forty men, which I complied with, and sent them from the
Hessian Regiment of Knyphausen. At half-past three
o'clock the next morning advice was brought to me that,—firing
of musketry being heard at Paulis Hook,—it was
probably attacked, but having (soon after the command
was given me of this garrison) established with Major
Sutherland the signal he was to make in case he should be
attacked in such force as to require succour from hence,—namely,
to fire two pieces of cannon and to hang out three
lights,—and being informed that no cannon had been
heard or lights seen, I concluded that Buskirk was on his
return, and that some small party had been harassing his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>rear, the firing at that time having nearly ceased. However,
I immediately sent over to know what was the real
state of the post. Upon the return of the messenger, I
was filled with astonishment at receiving a letter from
Major Sutherland, saying that the enemy, having got
through the abattis, had taken the right-hand and centre
block-houses and the principal fort, but that the round
redoubt, in which was himself, with a Captain and twenty-five
Hessians, had been defended; that the left block-house
was likewise safe; and that the enemy had retreated,
carrying off with them the guards of the two block-houses,
which (though almost impregnable, except by cannon)
were shamefully abandoned, the detachment of Artillery
from the fort, and such officers and soldiers as were in
their barracks. He further added that he was under great
apprehensions of Colonel Buskirk's corps being cut off. I,
thereupon, without loss of time, sent over the flank companies
of the Guards, with 100 men from the Brigade, and
nearly the same number of Hessians, with a party of
Artillery, under the command of the Field Officer of the
day, Lieutenant-Colonel Cosmo Gordon. The light infantry
were pushed forward about ten miles; and Colonel Buskirk,
after the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup manqué</span></i>, made his retreat good to Paulis
Hook, without any loss, bringing four prisoners,—and the
Guards likewise took a Captain and six prisoners on their
march. What is nearly as extraordinary as the enterprise
itself and the success of it is, that the enemy, though in
full possession of the fort, did not spike a gun, destroy the
ammunition, or do the least injury to any of the buildings.
The strength of the garrison at the time it was assaulted
was about 200; and, by the returns I have received, there
were, <em>killed</em>, four sergeants, two corporals, and three privates;
<em>wounded</em>, two sergeants; and, <em>taken or missing</em>, four
subalterns, seven sergeants, five corporals, and ninety-seven
privates. Lieutenant Cockburne, who was the
Artillery officer on duty there, says that a soldier came to
the hut where he slept, within thirty yards of the fort, to
give him the alarm; that he instantly flew towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>fort, but found the enemy masters of it, whereupon he ran
to the block-house, and thereby saved himself from being
taken prisoner. The Commander-in-Chief was pleased to
order a Board of two Brigadier-Generals and three Field
Officers to assemble the day following, to inquire into the
cause of the affront suffered at Paulis Hook on the morning
of the 19th August, 1779, and to report to him thereupon;
and yesterday, having received the opinion of the Board,
he gave orders for putting Major Sutherland in arrest, and
for him to prepare to take his trial before a Court-martial,
upon a charge of 'general misconduct as Commandant of
Paulis Hook on the morning of the 19th inst.'" Major
Sutherland was ultimately acquitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The demand for Artillery officers became so great that the
Cadets who were attached to the companies in America were
commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the autumn of 1779,
by Sir Henry Clinton, as Commander-in-Chief, "to entitle
them to sit at Courts-martial and to command as officers."
This step, combined with the removal of many officers, who
were absent on sick leave, to the new invalid companies,
their places being filled with effective officers, rendered the
force in America more efficient than it had been at any previous
period of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the year 1780 commenced what may be called the
Southern epoch of the War of Independence, whose opening
scene was successful for the British arms, being the capture
by Sir Henry Clinton of Charlestown, South Carolina. Previous
to removing so large a portion of the New York garrison
to assist in his offensive operations, Sir Henry determined
to evacuate Rhode Island, bringing the troops—British and
Hessians—with Artillery and stores, to New York. Private
intimation was given to Lieut.-Colonel Innes, who commanded
the Artillery on the island, and he was thus able to make the
necessary preparations for the removal of stores, ammunition,
and horses. With such care and assiduity did he perform
the duty, that when the troops reached New York on the
27th October, 1779, the whole of his guns, stores, and horses—with
the exception of twenty—came with them. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>armament of Rhode Island, which was thus added to the
defences of New York, consisted of 20 field-guns, 9 howitzers,
17 mortars, and 72 iron guns of various calibres. From
want of vessels to convey it, over 1300 tons of hay were left
on the island, a commodity which could ill be spared. The
enemy made no attempt to molest the troops, either during
their embarkation or their retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the increase just mentioned to the armament
of New York, the Commandant was unable with the
guns at his command to arm the new fortifications which he
had been making. There is a memorandum in the Record
Office of the purchase by him of ten 12-pounder iron Swedish
guns for the new fortified lines near Fort Knyphausen, from
the North to the East River. These guns were exposed to
a careful proof, and were bought at the rate of 16<em>l.</em> per ton.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was immediately after the departure of Sir Henry
Clinton's force for Charlestown that the intense frost
occurred, mentioned in the last chapter as having closed
the navigation of New York, and deprived it of its insular
advantages. It had the effect of satisfactorily testing the
loyalty of the inhabitants, and of adding another proof of
General Pattison's ability and energy. In a report made by
him to Sir Henry Clinton, dated the 21st February, 1780,
he sketches the plan he had resolved on in case of attack;
and as it is an interesting contribution to the History of the
War, part of it is now given:—"As General Knyphausen
and General Tryon were pleased to approve of my disposition
of part of the garrison and militia troops for the
internal defence and security of the city and its vicinity,
I take the liberty of enclosing a copy of it. If the enemy
had crossed over at Harlem, or on the North River anywhere
to the south of the line of McGowan's Pass, the
42nd Regiment, the Brigade of Losberg, and the two
Anspach Battalions, were to have advanced to positions
which General Knyphausen had fixed upon, from Colonel
Clerke's house to the circular Redoubt on the East River,
and several light field-pieces were fixed upon sleighs,
ready to march to wherever they might be wanted. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>the Foundry Redoubt I placed a 24-pounder and two
6-pounders, with a 13-inch mortar, as commanding a long
reach of the North River; and in the new Star Fort near
it were added three small mortars.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The cannon upon the Fort and batteries were kept
loaded; the guard at your Excellency's quarters, as well
as all the others along the North River, from the time of
the ice being passable, were doubled every evening; and a
night piquet of a Captain and fifty men put on board the
'Earl Cornwallis,' Ordnance transport, which was so placed
at the Hay Magazine Wharf that her guns bore up and
down the river. An armed galley which lay near had also
every evening an officer and twenty-five seamen on board....
I had almost forgot to mention a little Corps
formed from the Baggage and Store Guards left in town,
which might be useful, if collected together. I therefore
put them under the orders of Major Small, and they made—with
those he had of the 84th Regiment—upwards of
200 men. I am sorry to have trespassed so much upon
your Excellency's time by giving this long detail, but
think it my duty, Sir, to inform you of the several steps
and precautions which have been taken for discharging the
important trust your Excellency was pleased to honour me
with.... I persuade myself that the recent proofs
of loyalty among so numerous a body of His Majesty's
subjects in this town cannot fail to be acceptable to your
Excellency, and I shall be happy if the endeavours I have
used to give vigour and exertion to it are so fortunate as
to be honoured with your approbation. All the Captains
of the City Militia, in order to render it as useful as possible,
have agreed to and subscribed certain regulations
(of which I enclose a copy), for punishing delinquents and
for keeping in repair and in good condition all their arms,
&amp;c.; and in order to their being instructed in the use of
them, they are to be out every Saturday in the afternoon,
and the Associated Volunteer Companies every Sunday. I
would therefore presume to hope, Sir, if your Excellency
shall please to approve of their continuing embodied, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>in a short time so respectable a force as 4000 men in arms,
with some knowledge in the use of them, may be capable
of giving such protection to this city, as may make a
garrison of less strength sufficient in general for the
defence of it."<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In a subsequent letter to Lord George Germaine, General
Pattison writes as follows:—"I will entreat your Lordship's
permission to recite further proof, since the Militia were
embodied, of their readiness and goodwill to aid and assist
the public service—a piece of justice I owe them. About
ten weeks ago the commanding Engineer applied for a daily
working party from this garrison of 500 men for completing
the <em>hither</em> line of defence, agreeable to the orders
that were left with him by Sir Henry Clinton, from the
North to the East River. As that number could not be
given without making the duty of the troops too severe, I
sent a requisition to the Associated and Militia Companies
to furnish a daily quota of 300 men for the purpose of
raising one of the new projected Redoubts. They most
readily acquiesced, and after thirty days' labour finished
the work in a very complete manner, and with as much
cheerfulness as they began it—<em>taking neither pay nor provisions</em>;—and
having thus raised a monument to their own
credit, I called it the Citizens' Redoubt, which the Commander-in-Chief
has been pleased to confirm. A more
recent instance of their good disposition to answer one of
the useful ends of their being put into military array was
shown upon the late move which General Knyphausen
made into the Jerseys. It was then thought necessary to
take over such a force as reduced my garrison to 700 men.
The ordinary guards could not with any safety or propriety
be lessened below 400. I was therefore under the necessity
of calling upon the Militia to act upon that occasion.
They most willingly complied, and furnished 150 men
with officers in proportion for many days together, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>though attended with loss by quitting their several avocations,
was productive of no murmur or discontented expressions,
and I had often the pleasure to see citizens of
large property standing sentinels over public stores and
magazines."</p>

<p class='c000'>These extracts are interesting to the ordinary reader, as
descriptive of New York during the British occupation; and
especially interesting to the Artilleryman as evincing the
great tact with which General Pattison must have governed
the city. The services of the inhabitants were not merely
acknowledged warmly by Sir Henry Clinton, but also by the
King.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let the reader now turn for a moment to the military
operation which had been the main cause of the reduction of
the New York garrison—the Siege of Charlestown, in South
Carolina.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Artillery on this expedition was commanded by Major
Traille, or Traile, an officer who has already been mentioned,
and who died, as a Major-General, in 1795. The fleet, with
the transports, reached Tybee on the 1st February, 1780,
after a succession of storms;—on the 9th they sailed for North
Ediste; and having reached it on the following day, the
Grenadiers and Light Infantry landed on John's Island, and
on the 27th the whole army crossed without opposition to
James's Island. One of the transports, conveying guns and
stores, with a detachment of Artillery under Captain Collins,
foundered at sea during a gale, but fortunately the crew and
the troops were picked up by a privateer. The stores, which
were considerable, including 1000 barrels of powder, had to
be replaced from New York without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as can be ascertained from the records, the guns
used in the siege were 24-pounders and 18-pounders; but a
number of 6-pounders and 3-pounders accompanied the force,
to be employed in the subsequent field operations. It was
the 1st April before Sir Henry Clinton commenced to erect
his battery, which he did at a distance of 800 yards from the
town: and by the 19th April the second parallel "had
been carried to 150 yards from the main works, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>(English) batteries had acquired a manifest superiority
over those of the besieged."<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The services of the fleet under Admiral Arbuthnot had
been eminently useful. On the 9th April he had availed
himself of a fair wind and flowing tide, and had passed Fort
Moultrie—a strong fortification on Sullivan's Island—which
was intended to defend the entrance to the bar. This step
took the Americans by surprise. As Lee writes, the uniformly
credited opinion that the American naval force could
successfully stop the enemy from passing the bar—inasmuch
as their ships would have to be lightened, taking out their
guns and other incumbrances—was at the moment of trial
found fallacious. "It was discovered that the American
frigates could not approach near enough to oppose the
passage of the bar with any kind of success; and we necessarily
abandoned without a struggle this point of defence
so much relied on."<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The summons to surrender immediately
followed; and the answer was that "duty and
inclination point to the propriety of supporting it to the
last extremity." General Lincoln was in command of the
garrison—an able and courageous officer, and one who
possesses additional interest in the eyes of Royal Artillerymen
from the fact that he was subsequently exchanged for
their brave brother officer, General Phillips, of whom more
will have to be said in this chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege was conducted sternly and without intermission.
In the words of the American historian "the answer was no
sooner received than the British batteries commenced the
dire assault, which continued without intermission." The
investiture of Charlestown, by extending his operations to
the north of Cooper's River, was Sir Henry Clinton's next
object. By detaching 1500 men under an excellent officer
Lieut.-Colonel Webster, and another whose reputation as a
dashing officer has lived longer among his enemies than his
friends, Lieut.-Colonel Tarleton, he completely succeeded in
his purpose. Further reinforcements from New York enabled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Clinton to strengthen this belt—which prevented the retreat
of the Charlestown garrison—and Lord Cornwallis assumed
the command of the forces on the land side. Then followed
in rapid succession the surrender of Mount Pleasant, Lempriere,
and Wando posts, and Fort Moultrie itself. "Soon
followed the completion of the third parallel, which placed
the garrison at the mercy of the besiegers. Unwilling,
from motives of humanity, to increase the hardships of the
unfortunate, the British Admiral and General a second
time demanded surrender. Lincoln, now, from necessity,
yielded up his army; but still, anxious to save the militia
and inhabitants from captivity, he excepted them in his
assenting answer, which exception being declared inadmissible,
the negotiation ceased. Reluctantly Sir Henry
Clinton renewed the contest by opening the batteries of
the third parallel, and pushed his works under their fire
to the brink of the canal, which by a sap to the dam was
drained.... The inhabitants became assured that
the concluding scene could not long be deferred, and
though heretofore devoted to the defence of the town, now
with one accord supplicated General Lincoln to relinquish
the exception made in their favour, and to accept the
terms proffered. The amiable Lincoln could no longer
hesitate in stopping the effusion of blood. He communicated
to Sir Henry Clinton his readiness to lay down his
arms upon the conditions before offered. Highly honourable
was the conduct of the British commanders. They
did not press the unfortunate, but agreed that the terms
before rejected should form the basis of capitulation, which
being soon prepared, signed, and ratified, Charlestown was
surrendered on the 12th May, 1780, six days after the
parallel was finished."<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Daring, or rather immediately after, the siege, a painful
occurrence took place, which is thus alluded to in a report
from the officer commanding the Royal Artillery:—"Although
your Lordship is doubtless in possession of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>essential particulars relative to the reduction of Charlestown,
I nevertheless beg leave to enclose the copy of the
return I received from Major Traille of the killed and
wounded during the siege of that town. I most sincerely
regret the loss of that valuable officer, Captain Collins, as
well as the rest who shared his unhappy fate. The misfortune
was owing to the incautious proceedings in collecting
and assorting the arms of the rebel prisoners in a
house where a quantity of powder happened to be lodged.
Besides the officers and soldiers, there was a conductor
of stores and several artificers who perished by this
accident."<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The rejoicings in New York on receipt of the intelligence
of the fall of Charlestown are thus described in the Commandant's
official report:—"We were made happy in the fullest
degree by the glad tidings of the surrender of Charlestown
and its garrison. So universal a joy was spread on the
occasion in this city as was never known before; and if
there be any who do not really feel it, they at least affect
to express it. Permit me, Sir, with the most heartfelt
satisfaction to offer my congratulations upon this glorious
event."<a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In writing to Major Traille, General Pattison said:—"The
encomium you give of the good behaviour of the officers
and men of the Artillery during the siege of Charlestown
cannot fail to be very agreeable to me. I sincerely regret
the loss of poor Collins, and all who shared his unhappy
fate. The escape young Macleod had upon that occasion
was very fortunate."<a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In a very short time after the fall of Charlestown, South
Carolina was cleared of rebels by the English troops, and
Sir Henry Clinton returned to New York, leaving Lord
Cornwallis in command.</p>

<p class='c000'>The state of affairs in America at this time cannot but
awaken comment and speculation in the student's mind.
The speculation may be idle, but it is instinctive. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>was the state of the rebel army at this time? of the rebel
Government? of the rebel fleet? Let their own historian—so
often quoted here—reply. The army was demoralized,
neglected, almost mutinous. The Government was imbecile,
interfering, and incapable. As to naval operations, Lee's
own words were as follows:—"Every attempt made by the
naval force of the enemy during the war succeeded: ...
and many such operations took place." And yet we
lost our colonies.</p>

<p class='c000'>New York was ours,—thoroughly, loyally ours, in spite of
all that American writers may say. Canada was ours; then,
as now, loyal and true. The great Middle and Western
States did not exist, which now so swell the strength of the
great Republic in riches and in muscle. And yet we lost
our colonies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our fleets more than matched their foes; our soldiers
fought then as well as they have ever fought since. The
Peninsula, the Crimea, India itself, cannot show in their
annals more determined courage than was shown in the
English ranks between 1775 and 1781. And yet we lost
our colonies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where was the weak place in our harness? God help us!
it was where it will be again if Englishmen do not take
care; if Englishmen do not sink class and party differences
when the word is given to fight; if Englishmen do not remember
that a nation is weak when disunited, and its army
at such a time is weaker still.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was another weak point, and to it we must now
come in our narrative. Our Generals during this great war
were brave; they were even in their way able; and, as we
have seen, they were frequently successful. But they were
in presence of a Master. Pettiness, obstinacy, blundering,
on the part of his Government might vex and weary Washington;
reluctance and timidity on the part of his allies
might at times nearly ruin his plans; but his courage, his
skill, his confident hope, survived and surmounted all obstacles.
If one reckons up the qualities which make a
General, we shall find he possessed them all. Patriotism—it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>was his almost to an exaggerated extent; for, having once
adopted a view which he considered patriotic, he did not care
to reason. Enthusiasm—would God that every man who
draws a sword for England had but one-half of that which
swelled Washington's bosom! Purity of motives—who can
think of the scenes which are now historical, when he would
have resigned the power he had so justly earned, without
feeling (even after all these years) that he is in the antechamber
of a man who was pure and above reproach? And
skill—if any man doubts it, let him think of that scene at
Yorktown to which this chapter slowly leads. To see one's
schemes mature so surely and so happily is the highest
reward for his exertions for which a General can hope; and
as in this case it implied that independence for his country
which had been his sole and unselfish aim, one can conceive
Washington ready, even then, to resign his command and
sheath his sword.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was to America what Wallace was to Scotland, and
Garibaldi to Italy; but he had a larger sphere of action
than the former, and a more statesmanlike mind than the
latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>With dissension at home, and Washington against them in
the field, who can wonder that, in spite of continued courage
and spasmodic success, our armies failed to secure our
colonies?</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>There was an acting-bombardier in the Royal Artillery,
named Richard Atkinson Boddy, who died at Woolwich on
the 18th January, 1837. Animated by the same desire
which has filled the breast of many an Artilleryman, to commemorate
in some durable form the services of his corps,
Bombardier Boddy commenced to make extracts from all
military histories which touched on the subject which he
had so strongly at heart. A manuscript volume of such
extracts was left by him at his death, and was thus alluded
to in his will:—"To the library of the non-commissioned
officers of the Royal Artillery I bequeath a manuscript
book of the services of many of the officers, written by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>myself. In the event of the dissolution of the library, I
will that the book do revert to my father."</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the extracts contained in this volume are three,
referring to the operations in America subsequent to the
capture of Charlestown, and describing in detail the affairs
known as Camden, Ninety-six, and Guildford.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before proceeding to other operations, the result of Bombardier
Boddy's industry will be communicated to the reader.
And if by means of this work any tribute can be paid to the
memory of a non-commissioned officer, whose <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>, diligence,
and unselfish labour are well worthy of imitation, not merely
will justice have been done, but others may be inspired to
follow his example. There is no rank in the service in which
men may not do something,—not merely to add to, but
also to commemorate, the distinction of the corps in which
they serve. In the case of the Royal Artillery this has been
emphatically proved, not merely by the industrious labourer
now mentioned, but also by one already quoted, the author
of 'England's Artillerymen.'<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Battle of Camden was fought on the 16th August,
1780. Lord Cornwallis commanded the English troops,
whose total strength did not exceed 2000. General Gates—who
had received General Burgoyne's submission at Saratoga—commanded
the Americans, who were nearly 6000 in
number. The Royal Artillery was represented by two subalterns
(one of whom, Lieutenant William Marquois, died on
the 15th October of wounds received during this action), two
sergeants, and fifteen men. In spite of the disparity of
strength, so complete was the victory of the English that
1000 of the enemy were killed or wounded; the pursuit by
Colonel Tarleton and the English cavalry extended as far as
twenty-two miles; the whole of the enemy's artillery, a
large number of waggons, and 2000 stand of arms were captured;
and "of the 6000 men who composed Gates's army,
not sixty could have again been collected."<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The English
regiments which most distinguished themselves were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>23rd, 33rd, and 71st, under Colonel Webster; and the heaviest
loss fell upon the 33rd. Four guns were present with the
Royal Artillery; but on account of the small number of
gunners, men from the Line or volunteers must have assisted
in working them. The total number of casualties on the
English side was as follows—<em>killed</em>, 70; and <em>wounded</em>, 250.</p>

<p class='c000'>The affair called "Ninety-six" in the MS. volume referred
to is identical with that known as the "Battle of Cowpens."
On this occasion the British were totally defeated, with a
loss of their guns, two in number. Fortunately for the
Royal Artillery, almost equal satisfaction can be obtained
from this defeat as from many victories. Lord Cornwallis, in
his despatch to Sir Henry Clinton, wrote as follows:—"In
justice to the detachment of Royal Artillery, I must here
observe that no terror could induce them to quit their
guns, and they were all killed or wounded in defence of
them." This engagement took place in January, 1781.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last of the three actions mentioned in the extracts
referred to, is that known as the "Battle of Guildford." It
was a victory for the English arms, but a most expensive
one. Nearly one-third of the Royal Army was left <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de
combat</span></i>. The Royal Artillery lost only Lieutenant Augustus
O'Hara and one gunner killed, and four men wounded.
Lord Cornwallis could not afford to follow up the victory;
and although he captured the enemy's artillery, and the
American losses far exceeded that of the English, there is no
doubt that from this day the American spirits rose, and Lord
Cornwallis's position became serious. The Battle of Guildford
was fought in March, 1781. The American force was
5000 strong, but about one-half was composed of militiamen,
who were of little use, and who fled to their homes after the
battle. The total strength of the British force did not exceed
2400 of all ranks. Soon after the battle, Cornwallis had to
commence a retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in this battle that Lieutenant Macleod of the Royal
Artillery—afterwards Sir John Macleod—behaved with a
skill and gallantry which Lord Cornwallis never forgot. If
the commendation of his own commanding officer must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>been agreeable, how much more that of his enemies! Lee in
describing this battle, of which he says, "On no occasion,
in any part of the world, was British valour more heroically
displayed," singles out young Macleod more than once for
conspicuous notice. On one occasion he says that one battalion,
which at a critical period had been driven back with
slaughter, had "its remains saved by the British Artillery."</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving now these three engagements, the reader is
requested to turn to an operation in the war, in which the
<em>Commander</em> of the English forces was an Artilleryman.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the beginning of 1781 Major-General Phillips, of the
Royal Artillery, who had been a prisoner since the convention
at Saratoga, was exchanged for the American General Lincoln.
He was immediately appointed, by Sir Henry Clinton,
to the command of a force of 2000 men to watch the French
and prevent them from sailing for the south. He was then
ordered to Virginia, to join General Arnold's force, which
had been ravaging the country almost unopposed, but which
was now in a somewhat hazardous position. On effecting the
junction with Arnold, General Phillips assumed the command
of the united force, numbering now about 3500 men. It was
a change for the better in every way. Arnold was disliked
by all under his command, for they never could forget that
he was a traitor; and as a soldier he was in every way
inferior to Phillips. Among the regiments forming the force
for the service on which Phillips was to be engaged in Virginia
were the 76th, 80th, Simcoe's Queen's Rangers, some
German troops, and Arnold's American Legion. On the 19th
April General Phillips proceeded up James River to Barwell's
Ferry, and on the 20th he landed at Williamsburg, a
body of the enemy's militia retiring on his approach. On
the 22nd he marched to Chickahominy; and on the 25th,—early
in the forenoon,—he set his army in motion for Petersburg,
reaching it in the evening. A small encounter with
some militia took place when within a mile of the town, in
which the rebels were defeated, with a loss of 100 killed and
wounded. Lee, in his 'Memoirs of the War in the Southern
Departments,' writes very severely of the way in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>untrained militia were exposed by the American Government
to the attacks of regular troops. His strictures, and the
lesson he draws from the experiences of this raid in Virginia,
are worthy of quotation at a time when it is becoming more
generally recognized in England that the profession of arms
is one requiring special training as much as any other.
"What ills," he writes, "spring from the timidity and impotence
of rulers! In them attachment to the common
cause is vain and illusory, unless guided, in times of difficulty,
by courage, wisdom, and concert.... Whenever
the commitment of our militia in battle with regulars
occurs, the heart of the writer is rent with painful emotions,
knowing, as he does, the waste of life resulting from
the stupid, cruel policy. Can there be any system devised
by the wit of man more the compound of inhumanity, of
murder, and of waste? Ought any Government to be
respected which, when peace permits the substitution of a
better system, neglects to avail itself of the opportunity?
Were a father to put his son, with his small sword drawn
for the first time, against an experienced swordsman,
would not his neighbours exclaim, 'Murderer! vile murderer!'
Just so acts the Government, and yet our parents
are all satisfied, although whenever war takes place, their
sons are to be led to the altar of blood. Dreadful apathy!
shocking coldness to our progeny!"</p>

<p class='c000'>In Petersburg, and, indeed, wherever the British troops
went in Virginia, all military stores belonging to the rebels
were destroyed, and the warehouses with their cargoes of
tobacco and flour were systematically burnt. Lee is very
severe in his description of this method of warfare, very
bitter in his denunciations of the human vultures who follow
conquering armies, and very ironical in his allusions to the
tobacco war carried on by the English; and yet, in the same
breath, he admits that no human foe went out to meet them
and give them battle; that everywhere there was, on the
part of the Americans, "a fatal want of preparation, of
military apparatus, and of system." Wanton and purposeless
devastation is strongly to be deprecated in war; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>was this raid a purposeless one? The garrison of New York
had been wofully weakened, and the English troops in the
south were at times dangerously divided. If the American
armies could not be drawn apart to meet the English by
hope of victory, perhaps they might be tempted by the hope
of saving Virginia from this "so dreadful visitation, precursor
of famine and of plague."<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Doubtless there was
this strategic purpose in the Virginian raid, just as there
was later in the raid in Connecticut, by which Clinton hoped
to tempt Washington back from that dreaded march which
culminated so triumphantly for him at Yorktown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, even admitting irregularities and excesses not to
be justified by strategy (although this need only be done for
the sake of argument, so much exaggeration is there in the
American accounts of this expedition), were there not special
reasons which might lead one to expect them? Who filled
the ranks of the American Loyalist Regiments which fought
under Phillips and Arnold? They were men who had lost
everything for their King, whose homes had been confiscated,
and who had been outlawed and execrated by their countrymen
because, forsooth, they had come to a different opinion on
a political question. Were these the men to walk through the
enemy's country with dainty step and gloved hand? There
is something brutalizing in war under the most favourable
conditions; but when the combatants commence with feelings
of hatred and thirst for revenge, he would indeed be a rare
disciplinarian who could prevent an occasional outbreak in
the course of a continued and successful campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 27th April, 1781, General Phillips, with his force,
marched for Chesterfield Court-house, and detached General
Arnold to a place called Osborne's. According to some
accounts, the two forces had again met before the circumstance
occurred which is now to be related; but, according
to a manuscript book in the Royal Artillery Record Office,
it was while some guns were attached to General Arnold's
detached force. It is not very material, but as it is to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>credit of the regiment whose services these pages commemorate,
one would rather believe that General Phillips,—an
Artilleryman himself,—had been in command, than General
Arnold. Some armed vessels had been collected in James
River for a special purpose by the Americans, and either the
whole or part of Phillips' force marched with a view to secure
them. In reply to a summons to surrender, the Commodore
replied that he was determined to defend himself to the last
extremity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two 6-pounders and two 3-pounders (the latter called
"grasshoppers" in Lee's account, a favourite nickname for
these guns, although sternly forbidden to be used in any
official returns to the Commanding Officer of Artillery) were
then taken to the banks of the river, with a detachment of the
Royal Artillery, under Captain Fage and Lieutenant Rogers.
The King's troops were exposed to the fire of the 'Tempest,'
twenty guns; the 'Renown,' twenty-six; the 'Jefferson,'
fourteen; and several smaller vessels. Some few hundred
Militia also kept up a fire from the other bank of the river.
It does not say much, for the American fire to find it recorded
that not a single English soldier was hurt. The fire of the
Royal Artillery seems to have been of a very different
description. According to one account, so effectual was it,
that, in a very short time, the ships were obliged to strike
their colours, and the Militia were driven from the opposite
shore. From want of boats the English were unable to
secure their prizes; and the Americans made their escape,
scuttling some of their vessels and setting fire to others.
The loss of the enemy, according to this account, was very
great, "owing to the well-directed fire of the British
Artillery." Lee's account is as follows: "Quickly two
sixes and two grasshoppers were brought to bear upon the
Commodore; when he as quickly scuttled and set fire to
his vessels, escaping, with his crew, to the northern banks
of the river,—one way of 'holding out to the last extremity,'
but not that commonly understood by the term." Among the
many services in which the Artillery was engaged during the
American War, perhaps none were quainter than this successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>duel between four light field-pieces and an armed squadron
of no inconsiderable strength, supported by troops on shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 29th April General Phillips marched, with the
main body, in the direction of Manchester, which he reached
on the following day, and where he destroyed a quantity of
stores. General Arnold went, with the remainder of the
troops, up the river in boats. Although the Marquis de la
Fayette, with a considerable force, was at Richmond, and
saw what was being done, he made no attempt to stop the
damage; and on the following day General Phillips returned
to Osborne's, where the engagement with the ships had
taken place. Here he became seriously unwell, with a bad
form of fever; and although he lingered to the 13th May,
he was unable to perform any active duty, and was carried
about in a vehicle until unable longer to leave his couch.
The army had reached Petersburg before he died. This place
is described by Lee as "the great mart of that section of the
State which lies south of the Appomattox, and of the
northern part of North Carolina, standing upon its banks
about twelve miles from City Point, and, after the destruction
of Norfolk, ranking first among the commercial
towns of the State." To the Royal Artilleryman this
Virginian town will always have a peculiar interest, as
having been the scene of the death of as brave and honourable
a soldier as ever served in the Regiment. From the glorious
day at Minden, his professional career of more than one-and-twenty
years had been one of credit to his corps, honour to
himself, and usefulness to his country. He had been thirteen
years in the Regiment before the Battle of Minden, so that
his total service when he died exceeded thirty-four years.
He was beloved by all who served with him, and was a model
for Artillerymen to imitate, in gallantry, ability, and <em>progress</em>.
He was eminently a progressive officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>With September, 1781, came the commencement of the
operations which virtually terminated the war. Sir Henry
Clinton and Lord Cornwallis held different opinions as to
the mode of prosecuting the war in Virginia: the former
devoting his energies to the defence of New York; the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>anxious for increased numbers with which to carry on
offensive operations. The Home Government was eager to
secure some point on the southern coast, where the Army
and Navy could mutually assist one another, and such a
point Cornwallis was ordered by Sir Henry Clinton to secure.
The place ultimately selected by him was a village called
Yorktown, on a peninsula between James and York Rivers,
along with the adjoining village of Gloucester, on the other
bank of York River. This position he fortified to the utmost
of his power, and communicated with Sir Henry Clinton at
New York, with a view to reinforcements being sent to his
assistance. Washington had completely deceived Clinton,
and had induced him to believe that New York, not Virginia,
was the object of the proposed operations of himself and his
French allies. Taken by surprise by the sudden movement
to the South now made by Washington and his forces, Clinton
endeavoured to recall him by invading Connecticut, but
without success; and having received an urgent letter from
Cornwallis on the 23rd September, he called a Council of
War, and on the 24th he wrote, promising to start about the
5th October with 5000 troops and twenty-three men-of-war
to relieve him. Had he fulfilled his promise, a great
disaster would have been spared; but instead of leaving on
the 5th, it was not until the 19th,—the very day that Cornwallis,
after a weary fortnight's expectation, had been obliged
to surrender,—that he left Sandyhook; nor did he arrive off
the Capes of Virginia until the 24th.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the gallantry of Cornwallis and his troops there has
never been any question. He did not surrender until his
ammunition was expended, his defences crumbled under the
enemy's fire, and hope of succour completely fled. Of the
gallantry of that portion of his troops in which the reader
of these pages is most interested, he himself thus wrote in
his official despatches: "Captain Rochfort, who commanded
the Artillery, and, indeed, every officer and soldier of that
distinguished Corps, have merited, in every respect, my
highest approbation."</p>

<p class='c000'>The force of Royal Artillery present at the capitulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>of Yorktown amounted to 167 of all ranks. The largest
number whom Lord Cornwallis had commanded during his
Virginian campaign did not exceed 233, with fifty additional
German Artillerymen. But, in addition to casualties before
the investment of Yorktown, the loss to the Royal Artillery
during the time between the 27th September and the 19th
October,—the date of the capitulation,—was as follows:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c012'>Killed</td>
    <td class='c011'>24</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c012'>Wounded</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c012'>Missing</td>
    <td class='c011'>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>There were also nineteen sick, in addition to the wounded,
on the day the garrison surrendered.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this crowning point of the American War the defenders
were as much outnumbered as Sir Henry Clinton was out-manœuvred
by Washington. It is impossible to praise too
highly the tactics of the latter General on this occasion.
The difficulties with which he had to contend were numerous.
A spirit of discontent and insubordination had been manifested
during the past year among his troops; there was a
Loyalist party of no mean dimensions in the South; in
Pennsylvania he could reckon on few active supporters; and
New York,—stronger now than ever, after six years of
British occupation,—seemed hopelessly unattainable. Worse
than all, however, the French Admiral was nervous, and
reluctant to remain in so cramped a situation with so large
a fleet. Had he carried out his threat of going to sea,
instead of yielding to Washington's earnest entreaties and
remonstrances, the capitulation would never have taken
place. Lee's description of the scene on the day the garrison
marched out is doubly interesting, as being that of a
spectator: "At two o'clock in the evening the British Army,
led by General O'Hara, marched out of its lines with
colours cased and drums beating a British march. The
author was present at the ceremony; and certainly no
spectacle could be more impressive than the one now
exhibited. Valiant troops yielding up their arms after
fighting in defence of a cause dear to them (because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>cause of their country), under a leader who, throughout
the war, in every grade and in every situation to which
he had been called, appeared the Hector of his host.
Battle after battle had he fought; climate after climate
had he endured; towns had yielded to his mandate; posts
were abandoned at his approach; armies were conquered
by his prowess—one nearly exterminated, another chased
from the confines of South Carolina beyond the Dan into
Virginia, and a third severely chastised in that State, on
the shores of James River. But here even he, in the
midst of his splendid career, found his conqueror.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The road through which they marched was lined with
spectators, French and American. On one side the Commander-in-chief,
surrounded by his suite and the American
staff, took his station; on the other side, opposite to him,
was the Count de Rochambeau in like manner attended.
The captive army approached, moving slowly in column
with grace and precision. Universal silence was observed
amidst the vast concourse, and the utmost decency prevailed;
exhibiting in demeanour an awful sense of the
vicissitudes of human fortune, mingled with commiseration
for the unhappy.... Every eye was turned,
searching for the British Commander-in-chief, anxious to
look at that man, heretofore so much the object of their
dread. All were disappointed. Cornwallis held himself
back from the humiliating scene, obeying emotions which
his great character ought to have stifled. He had been
unfortunate, not from any false step or deficiency of
exertion on his part, but from the infatuated policy of his
superior, and the united power of his enemy, brought to
bear upon him alone. There was nothing with which he
could reproach himself: there was nothing with which he
could reproach his brave and faithful army: why not then
appear at its head in the day of misfortune, as he had
always done in the day of triumph? The British General in
this instance deviated from his usual line of conduct,
dimming the splendour of his long and brilliant career....
By the official returns it appears that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>besieging army, at the termination of the siege, amounted
to 16,000 men, viz. 5500 Continentals, 3500 militia, and
7000 French. The British force <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span></i> is put down at
7107; of whom only 4017 rank and file are stated to have
been fit for duty."</p>

<p class='c000'>With this misfortune virtually ends the History of the
American War,—certainly as far as the Royal Artillery's
services are concerned. Another year, and more, was to pass
ere even the preliminaries of the Treaty of Independence
should be signed; and not until 1783 was Peace officially
proclaimed: but a new Government came into power in
England in the beginning of 1782, one of whose political
cries was "Peace with the American Colonies!"; and
Rodney's glorious victory over the French fleet on the 12th
April in that year made the Americans eager to meet the
advances of the parent country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Henry Clinton resigned in favour of Sir Guy Carleton,
and Washington remained in Philadelphia. The companies
of Artillery were detailed to proceed to Canada, Nova Scotia,
the West Indies, and a proportion to England, on the evacuation
of New York, which took place in 1783; the Treaty of
Peace having been signed on the 3rd September in that year
at Versailles. The same Treaty brought peace between
England and her other enemies, France and Spain, who had
availed themselves of her American troubles to avenge, as
they hoped, former injuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as comfort and satisfaction can be obtained from
the study of an unsuccessful war, they can be got by the
Royal Artilleryman in tracing the services of his Corps during
the great war in America. Bravery, zeal, and readiness to
endure hardship, adorn even a defeated army; and these
qualities were in a high, and even eminent degree, manifested
by the Royal Artillery. In the blaze of triumph
which is annually renewed in America on the anniversary of
their Declaration of Independence, Americans do not, it is
hoped, forget that, whether England's cause was just or not,
her soldiers were as brave as themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>A few words may here be introduced with reference to
such of the officers of the Regiment as were engaged in this
war, and afterwards obtained high professional reputation.
A summary of their services may be taken from the valuable
Appendix to Kane's List. In addition to General Pattison,
whose career has already been sketched, the following officers
may be mentioned:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Major-General <span class='sc'>Thomas James</span>, an officer who held a
command during the early part of the War of Independence;
who wrote a valuable work on Gibraltar, entitled "The
Herculean Straits;" and who died in 1780, as a Colonel-Commandant.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Lieut.-General <span class='sc'>S. Cleaveland</span>, an officer who has
already been mentioned as having commanded the Royal
Artillery during the American War, prior to the arrival of
General Pattison; who had previously served in the West
Indies and at the capture of the Havannah; and who died in
1794, also in the rank of Colonel-Commandant.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Lieut.-General <span class='sc'>F. Macbean</span>, an officer frequently mentioned
in this volume, as having been present at Fontenoy,
Rocour, Laffeldt, Minden, Warberg, Fritzlar, and in Portugal.
He was appointed to the command of the Royal Artillery in
Canada, in 1778; was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1786; and died in 1800, as Colonel-Commandant of the
Invalid Battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Major-General <span class='sc'>W. Phillips</span> has already been repeatedly
noticed in this volume, and his death during the war already
recorded.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. General Sir <span class='sc'>A. Farrington</span>, Bart., served in America
from 1764 to 1768, and from 1773 to 1783, having been engaged
in most of the engagements during the war, up to
the Capture of Philadelphia, after which he commanded the
Artillery in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "He commanded the
Royal Artillery at Plymouth in 1788-9, at Gibraltar in
1790-1, at Woolwich 1794-7 and in Holland in 1799. He
was D.C.L. of Oxford, and in consideration of his long
and valued services he was created a Baronet, on the 3rd
October, 1818. He served in three reigns, for the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>period of sixty-eight years, being at the time of his death
the oldest officer in the British service, retaining the use
of his faculties, and performing the functions of his office
to the last."<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>6. Lieutenant-General <span class='sc'>Thomas Davies</span> is thus mentioned
in Kane's List: "He saw much service in North America
during the operations connected with the conquest of
Canada. At one time (while a Lieutenant) he commanded
a naval force on Lake Champlain, and took a French frigate
of eighteen guns after a close action of nearly three hours.
Lieutenant Davies hoisted the first British flag in Montreal.
He served as Captain of a Company in the most important
actions of the American Revolutionary War. During his
long service he had command of the Royal Artillery at
Coxheath Camp; also at Gibraltar, in Canada, and at
Plymouth. He was also two years Commandant of
Quebec." This officer joined as a cadet in 1755, and
died as a Colonel-Commandant in 1799.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. General Sir <span class='sc'>Thomas Blomefield</span> will receive more detailed
notice when the story of the Copenhagen expedition,
in 1807, comes to be written in these pages. His services
during the American War are thus summarised by Kane's
List: "In 1776, Captain Blomefield proceeded to America
as Brigade-Major to Brigadier Phillips. Among his services
at this period was the construction of floating
batteries upon the Canadian Lakes; and he was actively
engaged with the army under General Burgoyne until
the action which preceded the unfortunate convention of
Saratoga, when he was severely wounded by a musket-shot
in the head. In 1780 Captain Blomefield was appointed
Inspector of Artillery, and of the Brass Foundry....
From this period (1783) dates the high character of British
cast-iron and brass ordnance. Major-General Blomefield
was selected, in 1807, to command the Artillery in the
expedition to Copenhagen, and received for his services on
this occasion the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>a baronetcy." He died as a Colonel-Commandant on 24th
August, 1822.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Major-General <span class='sc'>Robert Douglas</span> has already been mentioned
for his gallantry as a subaltern during the American
War. In 1795 he was appointed Commandant of the Driver
Corps, an office which he held until 1817. He died at
Woolwich, in 1827, as a Colonel-Commandant of a Battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Lieutenant-General Sir <span class='sc'>John Macleod</span> has already been
mentioned in connection with the Battle of Guildford, and
will receive more detailed notice in the next volume, his
own history and that of his Regiment being indissolubly
woven together. It may here be mentioned, however, that,
"on his return from America, he was placed on the Staff of
the Master-General; and from this time till his death he
was employed in the important duties of the organization
of the Regiment, and of the arrangement and equipment of
the Artillery for all the expeditions (of which there were
no fewer than eleven) during this period. He held successively
the appointments of Chief of the Ordnance Staff,
Deputy-Adjutant-General, and Director-General of Artillery.
He commanded the Royal Artillery during the
expedition to Walcheren in 1809. In 1820 George IV.,
desirous of marking his sense of his long and important
services, conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and
invested him with the Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic
Order."<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> The whole of his official letter-books, during
the time he was Deputy-Adjutant-General of Artillery, are
deposited in the Royal Artillery Record Office, and afford a
priceless historical mine to the student. His letters are
distinguished by rare ability and punctilious courtesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. General Sir <span class='sc'>John Smith</span>, who had been in Canada since
1773, was taken prisoner by the rebels, at St. John's, in
November, 1775. In 1777 he was exchanged, served under
Sir William Howe, and was present at Brandywine Creek,
Germantown, the Siege of Charlestown, and at Yorktown.
He commanded the Artillery under Sir Ralph Abercromby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>in the West Indies in 1795; accompanied the Duke of York
to Holland in 1799; and served at Gibraltar from 1804 to
1814, being Governor of the place at the conclusion of his
service. He died as Colonel-Commandant in July, 1837.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly may be mentioned Lieut.-General Sir <span class='sc'>Edward
Howorth</span>, one of the officers taken prisoner at Saratoga. He
commanded the Royal Artillery in later years at the battles
of Talavera, Busaco, and Fuentes d'Onore. He died as
Colonel-Commandant of a Battalion in 1821.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will now enter upon a region of statistics,
which, at the date of the publication of the present work,
possess a peculiar interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickened as promotion had been by the extensive active
service, and proportionate number of casualties in the Regiment,
between 1775 and 1782, it was still unsatisfactory;
and with a future of peace, it was certain to become more so.
It was necessary to introduce some remedy, and, in doing so,
the Board of Ordnance adopted wisely the principle pursued
in later times by the late Secretary of State for War,
Mr. Cardwell, and made an organic change in the proportions
of the various ranks, instead of accelerating promotion
in a temporary, spasmodic way, by encouraging unnecessary,
impolitic, and costly retirements. Mr. Cardwell, in 1872,
when shadowing forth his views on this subject to the House
of Commons, was unconsciously maturing the scheme commenced
by the Ordnance in 1782—commenced, but never
completed—for the Temple of Janus was not long shut after
1783; and war postponed for many years the necessity of
accelerating a promotion which had ceased to be stagnant.
The dullness which followed 1815 was relieved periodically
by augmentations to the Regiment in the form of other
battalions; but the relief was only temporary, and a darker
shadow than ever loomed on the Regimental horizon, when
Mr. Cardwell took office. His remedy was complex; but
included, in a marked manner, the idea, born in 1782, of
reducing the number of officers in subordinate positions, and
increasing the proportion of field officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a Royal Warrant, dated 31st October, 1782, His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Majesty was pleased on the recommendation of the Board of
Ordnance to declare that "the present establishment of our
Royal Regiment of Artillery is in respect to promotion
extremely disadvantageous to the officers belonging thereto,
and that the small number of field officers does not bear
a due proportion to that of officers of inferior rank."
With a view to "giving encouragement suitable to the
utility of the said corps, and to the merits of the officers
who compose it," His Majesty decided that on the 30th
of the following month the existing establishment should
cease, and another be substituted, of which the two prominent
features were—as will be seen by the annexed tables—a
very considerable increase in the number of field officers,
and the reduction of one second lieutenant in each company.
It was also decided that the second lieutenants remaining
over and above the number fixed for the new establishment
should be borne as supernumeraries until absorbed, and that
stoppages should be made in the following manner to meet
the expenses of their pay, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The annual total of this stoppage—amounting to 1058<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em>—was
in the first instance applied to the payment of the
supernumerary second lieutenants, and any surplus that
might remain was ordered to be divided annually on the
31st December (in proportion to their pay) among the several
officers who were at the time contributing towards it; and
it was directed that as soon as the number of second lieutenants
should be reduced to one per company, the stoppages
should cease to be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of the alteration in the proportion of officers in
the various ranks is very distinctly shown by Colonel Miller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>in his pamphlet. Previous to the change, the proportion of
company to field officers had been as 21 to 1; now it became
as 8½ to 1.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following tables show (1) the establishment and cost
of the Regiment in 1782 prior to the introduction of the
new system; and (2) the proposed establishment, which
came into force on the 30th November, 1782. The number
of company officers—five per company—then fixed, remains,
to this day, unchanged in the Horse and Field Artillery;
but a subaltern per company or battery in the Garrison
Artillery was reduced by the late Secretary of State for
War, thus further improving the proportions of the field
and company officers:—</p>

<p class='c000'>With the Peace of 1783 came a reduction in the Regiment
from 5337 of all ranks to 3302, with a saving to the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>of the difference between 148,488<em>l.</em> 1<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>, the cost of the
old establishment, and 110,570<em>l.</em> 13<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>, the cost of the
new. But the reduction and the saving were not effected at
once. Every allowance was made for existing claims and
interests; and for the first year after the Peace of Versailles,
a charge was allowed of 129,373<em>l.</em> 11<em>s.</em> Two schemes were
submitted by the Board for carrying out the required reductions:
one left the number of non-commissioned officers
untouched; the other reduced it by one-half and spared the
privates, who now were to receive the title of gunner universally,
that of matross being abolished. The first scheme
was approved, but only as a temporary measure, and many
of the details were left optional to the captains of companies.
In the words of the Royal warrant, "If in any company the
commanding officer and captain should choose to keep all
the four sergeants, the four corporals, the nine bombardiers,
and the eighteen gunners, he will of course have
but twenty-two matrosses to retain, and must discharge
the remainder, as each company is to consist only of sixty
men, whether non-commissioned officers or privates (including
three contingent men), besides the two drummers,
so that a company wishing to preserve its present sergeants,
corporals, bombardiers, and gunners, will be composed of
as follows, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c000'>All honour to the Duke of Richmond! No Master-General
ever penned a more considerate and kindly Warrant, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>none ever more fully realized the speciality of the Artillery
service. "Without prejudice to their companies:" here is the
true Artillery unit officially recognized. No word of battalions:
these were mere paper organizations, devoid of all
tactical meaning. History in the end always preaches
truth; and at the close of a seven years' season of very
earnest war, the uppermost thought in the mind of his
Grace—the Colonel <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i> of the Royal Artillery—was
the welfare of <em>the companies</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pruning-knife had to be used, for the taxpayers of
England were yet staggering and reeling under the burden
of wide-spread and continuous hostilities; but it was to be
used with all tenderness for the susceptibilities of the true
Artillery unit, and of the captains through whom the needs
of that unit found expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reductions having been decided upon, the following
was the first distribution of the Regiment after the Peace of
Versailles:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>First Battalion.</span>—Six companies were ordered to Gibraltar
to relieve the five belonging to the Second Battalion,
which had been stationed there during the Siege. Four
companies went to the West Indies, and one was reduced.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Second Battalion.</span>—The whole ten companies of this
battalion were ordered to Woolwich.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Third Battalion.</span>—The companies were directed to be
stationed as follows: five at Woolwich; one at the Tower;
two at Portsmouth; one at Plymouth; and one at Chatham.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Fourth Battalion.</span>—Three companies of this battalion
were stationed in Jamaica, four in Canada, two at Halifax,
Nova Scotia, and one in Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides various small detachments in Great Britain, the
Invalid Battalion had to find the Artillery part of the garrisons
of Jersey, Guernsey, Newcastle, and Scotland. It will
be observed that Ireland is not mentioned, that country being
garrisoned by the Royal Irish Artillery, which still enjoyed
a separate existence.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>On a November night in 1783, a large gathering of Artillery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>officers took place at the 'Bull' Inn, on Shooter's Hill,
to welcome Colonel Williams and the officers who had served
during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, on their return to
England. Among those present were officers who had served
in the Regiment during the Seven Years' War, in the
American War of Independence, in the East and West
Indies, and in Minorca, besides those guests whose deeds
had attracted such universal admiration. This convivial
meeting seems a fit standpoint from which to look back on
the years of the Regiment's life and growth between 1716
and 1783. From the two companies with which it commenced,
it had now attained forty <em>service</em>, and ten <em>invalid</em>
companies; and instead of pleading—as was done in its
infancy—inability to find men for the foreign establishments,
it was able now to furnish Artillery for Canada,
Gibraltar, and the West Indies, to the extent of twenty
companies, besides finding drafts for the service of the East
India Company, one of which had left only a few nights
before this gathering to welcome the Gibraltar heroes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already the motto—not to be given until 1832—had been
earned; already <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubique</span></i> represented the services of the
corps; already <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo fas et gloria ducunt</span></i> represented the
aspirations of its members.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much jealousy had been displayed by the other arms of
the service; but it merely served to consolidate the scattered
Regiment, and to awaken as decided a Regimental <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>, as
existed in smaller and less distributed corps. The decisions
on points of difference had almost invariably been in favour
of the Royal Artillery: in 1756 the Artillery were directed
to take the right of other troops on parade; and every argument
as to the status of the officers was answered in their
favour up to 1751, when all doubt on the subject was removed,
and all discussion ceased, by the King instead of the Master-General
signing their commissions.</p>

<p class='c000'>On every occasion when the services of the corps were
required, the zeal and ability of officers and men were readily
acknowledged; and their conscientiousness in duty was as
conspicuous as their knowledge of their profession. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>with this sense of duty and professional skill, came that loveable
feeling so well described in the words quoted in the
introductory chapter of this volume. "It has ever been our
pride, as a corps, to be regarded as one family; and if one
member of it, in any remote part of the world, in any way
distinguished himself, it was felt universally that he had
reflected credit and honour on the whole corps." In this
gathering among the woods on Shooter's Hill, on that November
night, this Regimental feeling found expression.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c000'>Many of the readers of this volume are doubtless familiar
with the beautiful interior of the new Garrison Church at
Woolwich, the Walhalla of the Royal Artillery. Over the
communion table, memorial windows have been placed by
the officers of the Regiment, "To the glory of God, and in
commemoration of the services of their Corps during the
great wars with France and Russia." As autumn deepens
into winter, and the twilight comes down during the evening
service, many must have noticed how with the dying light
all the figures in the painted windows sink away in shadow
and darkness, with the exception of the centre figure, whose
pale form—ghastly pale as Rubens' Dead Christ in Antwerp
Cathedral—seems to start out from the darkness, and become
more distinct as the others fade away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is the simile far-fetched—it certainly is not irreverent—to
say that, as out of the gathering chancel-gloom He, the great
emblem of affection and duty, seems to come and linger
among his worshippers, so out of the twilight of the receding
years there seems to stand amid all the dimness and uncertainty
of details—the confusion of figures—the forgetfulness
of even great facts, a grand eloquent figure of Duty, learnt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>in stern warfare, impressed in no idle peace, and loved in
exact proportion as the heart became inspired by increasing
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</span></i>, and enlarged by unselfish pride?</p>

<p class='c000'>Duty needs not love, nor encouragement, to make it noble;
but a warm blush comes into the marble cheek, and a quickened
pulse to the strong heart, when affection and duty go
hand in hand, and the two great lessons of the God-man—love
and obedience—blend unconsciously into one.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the sixty-seven years of the Regiment's existence,
at the date when this chapter concludes, this blending had
gradually and surely been effected; the fierce and selfish
spirit of the pre-regimental trains had disappeared, and an
unselfish ambition had taken its place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who shall say that in the sympathy of numbers there is
not a power incalculable? And who can say that in its
highest sense this sympathy can be attained without either
a common object, a common charge, or a common danger?
If the Regimental system failed in all else in military life,
it succeeds in answering these three requisites. A common
object—the attainment of a glory which can be common and
yet personal; a common charge—the great legacy of former
glory, which a man would be a craven if he let the breath
of scorn approach; and a common danger, which on service
shall knit every man to his neighbour, and in after times
shall bind them together again by sympathies and memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>At times, indeed, the gloom may be great; the twilight
may deepen with unnatural and unexpected rapidity; but
even among beaten, and dying, and darkening figures, <em>one</em>
must ever stand out in a Corps which has learnt true discipline—a
figure which twilight cannot shroud, and which
even disaster itself at times may illumine, which not even
monotonous routine, nor seemingly valueless tasks can dim—the
eternal and divine figure of Duty.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <span class='sc'>History, Succession of Captains, and Present Designation<br /> of the Troops and Companies belonging to the Royal<br /> Horse Artillery, the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Battalions.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c007'><span class='sc'>Although</span> the Royal Horse Artillery, and the Fifth,
Sixth, and Seventh Battalions were formed subsequently
to the Peace of 1783, it has been considered desirable to insert
a summary of the services of the troops and companies in
this volume, without prejudice to a more detailed statement
which will be given in the succeeding volume, when their
formation will be notified in due chronological order. The
Seventh Battalion brings the reader to the commencement
of the present century, later than which time it has not been
deemed necessary, in this volume, to go.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commencing with the Royal Horse Artillery, it may be
mentioned, shortly, that it was formed on the 1st January,
1793, and at first consisted of two Troops, A and B. On the
1st November in the same year C and D Troops were added,
followed, on the 1st November, 1794, by E and F Troops.
In September 1801, G Troop was formed, in Ireland, out of
some detachments serving in that country; and in June,
1804, H Troop was raised at Woolwich. On 1st February,
1805, I Troop was formed at Colchester, and K Troop at
Ballinasloe; L Troop at Woolwich in July of the same year,
and M Troop also in 1805, although there is a little uncertainty
as to the month. There were also two Rocket
Troops, but there is considerable difficulty in tracing their
exact history. According to the records of the Royal Horse
Artillery, the Second Rocket Troop was formed before the
First; but in this particular, as in another presently to be
mentioned, these records are inaccurate. The following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>would appear to be the true statement of the case. In June
1813, some Rocket detachments, under Captain R. Bogue,
were ordered to Germany, and were present at the Battle of
Leipsic. In 1814 a Rocket Troop was formed at Woolwich,
under the command of Captain W. G. Elliot; and <em>on the same
day</em> Captain E. C. Whinyates was appointed to the command
of the Second Rocket Troop <em>vice</em> Bogue, <em>killed at Leipsic</em>.
Now, the Battle of Leipsic was fought in October—1813, and
Captain Whinyates' appointment was dated the 2nd March
1814. It would appear, therefore, that the two Rocket
Troops were formed <em>together</em>, out of <em>existing detachments</em>, and
that the one formed at Woolwich was named the First, while
that formed out of the detachments on the Continent was
called the Second. Although the detachments present at
Leipsic became the Second Rocket Troop, they were present
at that battle not as a troop, but as detachments; and as
the troop was reduced on 31st July 1816, their Leipsic
services, by some mistake, were afterwards credited to the
First Rocket Troop, which would actually appear to have
received permission to wear "Leipsic" on its appointments
in commemoration of the services, not of itself, but of the
defunct troop.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1847 rocket carriages were given to all the troops, and
the remaining Rocket Troop became I Troop of the Royal
Horse Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the Second Rocket Troop, D Troop also was
reduced in 1816; and, in spite of strong remonstrances,—among
others, from the late Sir Robert Gardiner, then Captain
of E Troop,—the titles of all the troops below D were
changed, E, F, G, H, and I becoming respectively D, E, F,
G, and H. The injury and inconvenience caused by this
alteration of nomenclature have proved very great. K, L
and M Troops were reduced at the same time, but being the
juniors, their reduction did not affect the lettering of the
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January, 1819, B and G Troops were reduced; but
on this occasion no alteration was made in the designations
of the other troops. B Troop was reformed on the 1st
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>1855, as a reserve half-troop, under a Second Captain, and
was augmented to a full troop in the following year. G Troop
was reformed at Woolwich on the 1st December, 1857, and
also K Troop on the same day.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 1st July, 1859, with the introduction of the Brigade
System, came an alteration in the titles of the troops, which
were now designated as Batteries of the Horse Brigade. In
1862, on account of the amalgamation with the East India
Company's Artillery, the old Royal Horse Artillery became
the First Horse Brigade of the Royal Artillery; and in 1864,
to enable the Indian reliefs to be carried on without sending
the whole of the old Horse Artillery abroad at one time, the
First Horse Brigade was divided into A and B Brigades of
the Royal Horse Artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the date of this work (1872) the following list shows
the present designations of the old troops, as they stood in
1859:—</p>

<p class='c017'>On the 14th August, 1794, an augmentation of five companies
to the Royal Artillery was sanctioned, to be called, after
organization, the Fifth Battalion. The companies were
formed,—two at Plymouth and three at Woolwich,—by
transfers from other battalions. Major-General Duncan
Drummond was appointed Colonel <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en seconde</span></i>; the first
Lieutenant-Colonel was Edward Williams; and the Major,
Robert Douglas. Captains Rogers and Miller commanded
the companies formed at Plymouth, and Captains Hutton,
Harding, and Sproule, those at Woolwich. The following
was the strength of the five companies:—</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 6th March, 1795, five additional companies were
added to the battalion; and the total number of companies
remained ten until the year 1819, when Nos. 7 and 8 were
reduced; Nos. 9 and 10 becoming respectively Nos. 7 and 8.</p>

<p class='c000'>No very great augmentation to the strength of the
battalion took place during the earlier years of its existence,
except in the year 1804, when a second Colonel was added,
and also twenty men per company. The services of the
companies were very varied and distinguished, including the
Campaigns in Egypt, Cape of Good Hope, South America,
Spain, and Holland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Annexed is the history of each Company's active service,
and the succession of Captains up to the introduction of the
Brigade System:—</p>

battalion,—Nos. 9 and 10,—took place in December, 1800.</p>

<p class='c000'>The companies called above "The East India Detachment,"
which formed the nucleus of the Sixth Battalion,
embarked at Woolwich for India on the 19th April, 1791.
They left that country for the Cape of Good Hope in 1798,
arriving in October of that year, and remained until incorporated
in the newly-formed battalion, in 1799. They are
now C Battery 11th Brigade, and No. 6 Battery 5th Brigade.

<p class='c000'>The following was the dress of the battalion at its formation,
in 1799, as also of the whole Regiment, except the
Horse Artillery: the officers wore blue cloth double-breasted
coats, with scarlet lappels; the field officers had two epaulettes,
the company officers only one, which they wore on
the right shoulder; white kerseymere breeches; long black
leather boots, fastened to the back part of the knee of the
breeches by a black strap and buckle; and a cocked-hat,
with gold-loop and button, and white feather. The non-commissioned
officers and men wore blue cloth coats, single
breasted, laced in front and on the cuffs and flaps; the staff-sergeants
and sergeants with gold lace, and the rank and
file with yellow worsted lace. The staff-sergeants wore two
gold bullion epaulettes; the sergeants two gold-laced straps;
the corporals two fringe epaulettes; the bombardiers one
fringe epaulette on the right shoulder; the gunners two
worsted straps.</p>

<p class='c000'>The changes in dress during the succeeding years will be
noted in the succeeding chapters of this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Annexed is the list, as in former cases, of the various
companies, their successive Captains, and the military operations
in which they were engaged. In the Sixth Battalion,
as in the Horse Artillery, considerable confusion was created
by the reduction, in 1819, of Nos. 5 and 8 companies, and
the consequent altering of the numbers of Nos. 6, 7, 9, and
10 to Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The reduction of the
two junior companies, instead of Nos. 5 and 8, would have
rendered the student's task a far easier one.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>SEVENTH BATTALION.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The Seventh Battalion of the Royal Artillery was formed
on the 1st April, 1801. The Act for the Union between
England and Ireland received the Royal assent on the 2nd
July, 1800, and came into force on the 1st January, 1801.
From this measure arose, as has been mentioned in a former
chapter, the incorporation of the Royal Irish Artillery with
the older Corps; and it was transferred as the Seventh
Battalion of the Royal Artillery, consisting, at the date of
transfer, of ten companies, with a proportion of Field and
Staff officers. The incorporated officers took rank according
to the dates of their respective commissions; but they were
also allowed the option of retiring on full pay, or of taking
commissions in the Line. The non-commissioned officers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>and gunners who were approved for transfer received each a
bounty of three guineas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the companies were in the West Indies when the
transfer was effected; and on reference to the appended list it
will be seen that much of the active service of the Seventh
Battalion was carried on in these islands. It was in connection
with West Indian service that the Battalion obtained a
distinctive mark, as containing among its companies one
known always, until the Brigade system was introduced, as</p>

<h4 class='c033'>"<span class='sc'>The Battle-Axe Company.</span>"</h4>

<p class='c017'>The story of the circumstances under which this title was
earned is worthy of reproduction. The company in question
was originally No. 8 of the 7th Battalion, but in the year
1819, No. 7 Company being reduced, No. 8 became No. 7.
Under the altered nomenclature of 1859, it became and
now is</p>

<h4 class='c033'><span class='sc'>No. 2 Battery, 5th Brigade.</span></h4>

<p class='c017'>In the year 1808 the company was quartered in Halifax,
Nova Scotia. In December of that year it was ordered on an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>expedition for the capture of Martinique; forming part of
the force under Sir George Prevost, which included the 7th
Fusiliers, 8th King's, and 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The force arrived at Martinique on the 30th January, 1809,
and remained brigaded together during the attack, quite
distinct from the West Indian division under General Maitland,
which had arrived in company with Admiral Cochrane
and his fleet. On the 2nd February, 1809, the French met
the Halifax brigade under General Prevost, about half-way
between the bay where they landed and the town, but were
driven back with considerable loss. In one day, this company
prepared and armed a battery of six 24-pounders, and four 10-inch
mortars, and opened fire on the day following. On the
24th February the Garrison capitulated, for "the British
Artillery was so well served, that most of the Fort guns
were quickly dismounted."<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The officers of the company
were assembled by the General to consult as to what should
be bestowed on the company as a reward of bravery and good
conduct. It was first contemplated to give a one-pounder
French gun, beautifully mounted, but the officers, knowing
that the company was about to return to Halifax, and a war
with America likely to take place, when they would be unable
to take the gun with them, chose an axe and a brass drum. A
brass eagle was affixed to the axe, which was always carried
by the tallest man in the company, who in virtue of his
office was permitted to wear a moustache.</p>

<p class='c000'>This version of the story was committed to paper by one
who was present with the company at Martinique, Master-Gunner
Henry McElsander, who joined it three years after
the amalgamation, and remained in it until promoted to be
Sergt.-Major at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.
It is completely corroborated by the Records of the Seventh
Battalion, from which the further history of the company
may be obtained. It returned to Halifax in April, and
remained in that station until May, 1813, when it sailed for
Quebec. It served in the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Canada. In the winter of the former year it was collected
in Kingston, Upper Canada, watching the enemy. Acting-Bombardier
James Keating, being detached with seven
gunners to Michilimackinac, distinguished himself in an
affair with the enemy, and his conduct was rewarded by a
commission from the Provincial Government. The company
was present at the operations against Fort Erie in August,
1814, and at the enemy's attack on the English position
before that place on the 17th September. It was also engaged
in the defence of the Log Bridge on the Chippawa. The two
officers present with the company during these hostilities,
Captain Walker and Lieutenant Carter,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> were specially mentioned
in despatches, and received permission to wear
"Niagara" on their appointments. The company returned
to Woolwich in 1823, and in 1831 again proceeded on foreign
service to the West Indies, whence it returned in 1837. Its
only additional foreign service prior to the introduction
of the Brigade system was at Gibraltar, where it served from
January, 1845 to January, 1851, and to which station it again
proceeded in May, 1855.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history, present designation, and succession of
Captains, of all the companies, will now be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereas our Royal progenitors established the number of
100 gunners with a yearly fee payable out of the Exchequer
and finding that divers of them were such as were not taught
nor trained up in the practice and knowledge of the Art of
Gunnery but men of other Professions and that by reason
of their receiving their fees by virtue of their patents out of
the Exchequer they did not attend according to their duties
as well for performance of Our Service as to be exercised and
trained up in that Art by Our Master Gunner at such time
as they were required thereunto and also that the places of
such Gunners and Mattrosses were commonly bought and
sold to such as would give most money though very unfit
for the said Employments whereby great inconveniences
and disappointments were occasioned for prevention whereof
We thought fit to Authorize Sir William Compton sometime
Master of Our Ordnance, by Our Warrant under Our Sign
Manual and Privy Signet, dated 2nd January, in the twelfth
year of Our Reign from time to time to grant his Warrant
to such person or persons as he should find fit and able to be
Entertained as fee'd Gunners in Our Service and Order that
the future payments of their respective fees should be placed
upon and made good to them out of Our Ordinary and
entered into the quarter books of Our Office and likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>We did empower Sir Thomas Chicheley late Master of Our
Ordnance by Our like Warrant bearing date 16th January
in the 22nd year of Our Reign to cause Our Master Gunner
or such other person as he should think fit to examine all
the Gunners and Mattrosses then employed within Our Kingdom
of England Dominion of Wales or town of Berwick-on-Tweed
commanding them to be subject to him and the Successive
Masters of Our Ordnance for the time being and that
if he should find any of the said Gunners or Mattrosses unfit

remove or cause them to be removed or dismissed from their
said employment and after such removal or after the death
resignation or voluntary departure of any such Gunner or
Mattross to commissionate and empower such Gunners or
Scholars as should be certified by Our Master Gunner of
England to be able to execute the duty of a Gunner or
Mattross in the place or places of such as should by him or
them be removed or be dead or have voluntarily resigned

appointed a Committee to inspect and examine the present

the Office of the Ordnance is One hundred whose pay is
sixpence per day each and many of them of other trades and
not skilled in the Art of Gunnery and that it was their
opinion that if this number were reduced to sixty effective
men whose pay might be twelve pence per diem and they
required to lodge in the Tower and duly exercised that it
would be much more useful for Our Service. Upon due consideration
of all which We have thought fit to dissolve the
said number of One hundred Gunners and do declare they
are hereby dissolved and that the said number from henceforward
shall be reduced to the number of sixty effective
men and no more and we do by these empower authorize

as he shall choose qualified as aforesaid for whose encouragement
We hereby direct and appoint that the said allowance

Mates of 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per diem be placed and made good to them
out of Our Ordinary of Our Said Office of Our Ordnance and

the said Warrants or Commission in Our said Office. And
We further require and direct that the said Gunners to be
chosen as aforesaid be constantly exercised by Our Master
Gunner of England once a week in winter and twice a week
in summer and to be kept to their duty either in Our Tower

Cousin and Councillor John Duke of Marlborough Master
General of Our Ordnance hath laid before Us a representation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>of Our Principal Officers of Our Ordnance setting forth
the inconveniences and defects of the present Establishment
of the Military Branch of Our said Office amounting to
16,829<em>l.</em> 11<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> and therewith a scheme showing that a
greater number of Gunners Engineers and other proper Officers
may be maintained for less than the present expense.
And whereas by Our Warrants of the 27th November 1715
two Companies of Gunners and Mattrosses were raised for the
service of Our Artillery sent upon the late Expedition to North
Britain and having been found always necessary that a sufficient
number of Gunners with proper Officers should be maintained
and kept ready for Our Service. And whereas it has
been represented unto Us by Our said Master General of
Our Ordnance that there are several salaries now vacant
of the present old Establishment which are not useful and
that other savings may be made by which part of the two
said Companies may at present be maintained. It is our will
and pleasure that the said vacancies and savings be immediately
applied for the payment and maintenance of one
Sergeant three Corporals thirty Gunners and thirty-two
Mattrosses being such as have served well abroad during the
late Wars and are not otherwise provided for and as other
salaries shall become vacant in the said military branch that
you apply the same to complete the pay of the rest of the
Officers and others according to the annexed list, which with
their respective pays We do hereby approve and establish
and for so doing this shall be as well to you as to the Auditors
of Our Imprest and all other Officers concerned a sufficient
Warrant. Given at Our Court of St. James's this 26th

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
